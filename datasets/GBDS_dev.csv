Man one  Aye, you want some of this shit?
Man two   Naw, I don't want that shit
Man one   I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna buss a cap in a nigga
Man two  Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga's crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car. Aight
Car revs up
Gunshots
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
Keep thinking I'm candy til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying Lord, Jesus help me cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun til you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
Cause we gon reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I own_name hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me best of me
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me testing me
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me blessing me
Finna run rap cause Dr. Dre got the recipe recipe, recipe
Yeah, ha ha, aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit, I might get a fucking concussion
But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Ha ha ha ha",nan,male,song,"

Man CARDINAL Aye, you want some of this shit? 
Man CARDINAL Naw, I don't want that shit 
Man CARDINAL I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna buss a cap in a nigga 
Man CARDINAL Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga's crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car. Aight 
Car revs up 
Gunshots 
If there's beef cock it and dump it 
The drama really means nothing to me 
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out 
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it 
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out 
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught 
The ORG can play this motherfucking tape in court 
I'll kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing 
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing 
Keep thinking I'm candy til ya fucking skull get popped 
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box 
In the hood DATE time is the killing season 
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason 
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding 
Saying Lord, PERSON help me cause they ass leaking 
When they window roll down and that PERSON come out 
You can squeeze ya little handgun til you run out 
And you can run for ya backup 
But them machine gun shells gon tear ya back up 
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that 
Cause we gon reload them clips and come right back 
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked 
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck 
Look, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood 
Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good 
If you was smart you'd be shook of me 
Cause I get tired of looking for ya 
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me 
If there's beef cock it and dump it 
The drama really means nothing to me 
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out 
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it 
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out 
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught 
The ORG can play this motherfucking tape in court 
I'll kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing 
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing 
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you 
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you 
Nigga, you know the streets talk 
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks 
I got my back against the wind 
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out 
If I die DATE I'm happy how my life turned out 
See the shootouts, I done been in em by myself 
Locked up I was in a box by myself 
I done made myself a millionaire by myself 
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help 
I PERSON hood 
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good 
With a pistol I define the definition of pain 
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains 
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same 
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game 
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains 
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains 
If there's beef cock it and dump it 
The drama really means nothing to me 
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out 
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it 
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out 
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught 
The ORG can play this motherfucking tape in court 
I'll kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing 
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you 
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing 
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me best of me 
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me testing me 
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me blessing me 
Finna run rap cause Dr. PERSON got the recipe recipe, recipe 
Yeah, ha ha, aye Dre 
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker 
Cause the windows on my motherfucking ORG is bulletproof, nigga 
Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga 
Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga 
But the ORG said if I get hit, I might get a fucking concussion 
But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Ha ha ha ha"
"If U Leaving, Then Leave...",50 Cent,"
Yeah, one-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
Bring it back, my shit
Yeah, one-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
One-two, one-two, y'all niggas know just how I do
Let's get more paper, more bread
It's grind time, I ain't fucking round, kid
Got a new case, D's ain't got no proof
Got a new Coupe, it ain't got no roof
Test me, see if I won't shoot
I'll cock that and bang that quick for the loot
Trey deuce, got it stashed in the boot
If there's a problem I get to the root
Go head get your ass shot being cute
You talk too much, boy, I'll put ya on mute
Beef with me you need more than a vest
And more than one strap I guess
You got me all fucked up

I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit
I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit
Startin to feel like there's nothin left to talk about but the, money, money
Bill collectors keep comin when a nigga fucked up, to get money, money
Nigga I don't give a fuck bout these hoes
I'm focused on the money, MONEY money MONEY!
Look, I don't wan talk bout these hoes
Let's talk about money, MONEY money MONEY!
In high school I had coke and dope money
I blew, now I'm sittin on Bugatti boat money
I'm eatin, I get money, nigga I shit money
It smell like Benjamins, it boosts my adrenaline
Go head fuck around, I got marksmen hit money
You fuckin with that EBT welfare WIC money
Who wan catch a fade? Fuck that! Catch a blade
Catch a case, bail bond, I'm out the next day
Got that gold Hammer), gold two Legit proper money
Talkin bout private jet, heliport chopper money
And a nigga still ridin with the chopper on me
I don't trick, e'ry now and then I toss her money
Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
I'll kill if I have to, don't force me homie
I get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
I hate when niggas act like bitches cause it costs me money
What the fuck!
I'm in London blowin pounds, Japan blowin yen
It's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
My stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
Nowadays I'm just happy things are goin my way
I'm straight, some say I got more than I need
Mucho dinero out in México, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got bridge truck money
Euros range, you wan borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggas like Damn!
Bitch I got more francs than a hot dog man
Get married, pay for one bitch, I'll buy her bar food
Kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit I do
Whassup?

I was a itty-bitty nigga when Prince killed PERSON 
I'm a shooter, ask Bizzy, he made us that way 
I spend seven-and-a-half hours bagging up grams 
Gotta watch these niggas with the sticky-ass hands 
See my face through a hundred grams chopped on the mirror 
Tell me I can't eat, I ain't trying to hear it 
PERSON wanted the bitches, I was trying to get my weight up 
Nigga get in the way and get shot down, straight up 
I'm grimy, yeah, my friends killed my friends 
Like Blackey, he did that shit to him 
Get at me, I'm back strapped up again 
I tried, I can't change, I'll always be the same 
I tell my little niggas fuck Preme 
And any motherfucker down with em can suck me - I'm still mad 
I got the cream to make a murder scene 
If y'all niggas ain't shooting y'all can't fuck with me, come fuck with me

You can't park round here while I'm down here

They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto, in a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's, I stash it What?), the MAC, I blast it Yeah
D's come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard

I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

G-Unit Bo!), we in here Bo! 
We can get the drama popping, we don't care Bo! Bo! Bo! 
It's going down Bo!), cause I'm around GPE 
John, you know how I gets down, down 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest 
Nah, that's a semi-auto, in a vest on my chest 
I try not to say nothing, the ORG might want to play in court 
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport 
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you 
You getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya 
I'm not the type to get knocked for PERSON 
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise 
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me 
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies 
CARDINAL G's, I stash it What?), the MAC, I blast it Yeah 
D's come, we dump the diesel in battery acid 
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it 
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard 
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel 
ORG pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle 
Blood What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
We don't play that 
We don't play that 
We don't play that ORG 
We don't play around 
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder 
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger? 
When the ORDINAL kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder 
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer 
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a CARDINAL 
Every chick I fuck with is a dime 
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own 
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone 
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya 
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches 
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us 
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, cuz? What? 
What up, blood? What? 
What up, gangsta? 
We don't play that 
We don't play that

Chase You Outta Here,50 Cent,"
You gotta watch your face
I told niggas I'm a hustler, it's like they keep on forgetting
thirty-six mil in eight months, you still think I'm bullshitting?
Catch me on top of Fortune's Hot one hundred
Head of G-Unit Enterprises, still getting blunted
Went from selling crack to rap, that's two different games
But they're parallel to each other, homie, so they're quite the same
You know that crack spot so hot, you better off playing the block
Fiends can't help but be fiends, they come and cop for the cops
Back in the pens again, penitentiary doors spin
The game full of heartbreaks, can I win for Christ sakes?
Ace after ace, Lady Luck just won't fuck with me
That's why I got this attitude, nigga don't say what up to me
I took something heart-pumping, move and I'll pop something
Cop bricks, break em down to pieces and prop something
Niggas stay in stunt mode so I stay strapped up
My body language saying 'fuck around and get clapped up'
I sip on Coke when it's with Henny, go for broke with the semi
Niggas talk behind my back, but they don't really want it with me
Pussy niggas pop shit, me I'm on that block shit
That rubber band, hundred grand in that night box, bitch
You know the raps bought the Benz, and the crack's bought the rims
Vivica she bought the gym, told ya I'm a fuckin pimp
I was born a bad seed, I defied the odds
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I switched the cards
Still I keep a poker face, frontin I'mma catch a case
Flip out, poke your face, you're laid out, now what a waste
I'm Super Fly Ron O'Neal of this rap shit
When that drama pop and you get shot
Let's see you bounce back, bitch
You nigga, you come around this bitch frontin
I'mma have to chase you outta here",nan,male,song,"

Royal fees ain't nothing, I just blow a little something
Now shorty got a thing for me, she feel like I'm the shit
My guess is I'm the kind of nigga she wanna be with
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it hot
She want me, yeah yeah, she want me
She want me, why you think she on me?
Get it, get it, get it
I'm a substitute teacher, welcome to Sex Ed
She'll be an A student time she get out my bed
I'm flashy, I'm rolling with the stones
Get at me, I'm moving with the chrome
A made man, a Don Corleone
No matter where I'm at I'm doing what the fuck I want
I'm shining, my wrists all canary
Now try me, I keep a shooter near me
I'm grinding like I ain't made my first mil
Like I ain't signed a first deal, like I ain't at the first meal
I'm hungry, I really want it all
Now watch me, I'll show you how to ball
Life in the fast lane, fast car, fast cash
Freak bitch, fast ass
I'm where the money at, mane, fast on the draw
Fast running from the law
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it",nan,male,song,"

When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and ORG 
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and PERSON 
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this 
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit 
Now Blood walk to this, now ORG walk to this 
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit 
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo fo faggot 
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget 
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too 
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue 
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues 
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu 
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways 
Heard you got CARDINAL lips and bleed for seven days 
I got fo fifths and bananas on the K's 
And got more whips than a runaway slave 
Me and PERSON go back like some high top fades 
When PERSON paid 
When I made sixty mill, PERSON got paid 
When I made CARDINAL mill, PERSON got paid 
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made 
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane 
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this 
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha 
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll 
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold 
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's 
Seventy CARDINAL PRODUCT old school when I roll 
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll 
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold 
I'm internationally known, it's the kid with the flow 
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though 
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto 
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo 
PERSON by the dashbox in case they want war 
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law 
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure 
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy 
I set the club on fire I told ya 
I'm the general salute me soldier 
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this 
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha 
Now work it out now, shorty work it out 
I wanna see you, break it down 
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about 
It's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out 
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out 
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out"
Ryder Music,50 Cent,"
Yeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back and cruise
Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell
The East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, let's go
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had yo favorite actress, from yo favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homie this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck, hands grippin on a TEC
Fool trippin threw a set, you can get yo ass wet
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid yo ass better come correct
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, let's go
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins uh-huh), I'm still thuggin
Cruisin', rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist
Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie, you hustlin backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid, chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm fallin', in love with success
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best
Rollin', Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner have your homies burnin', rest in peace candles
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns
Rappers I make em sick, when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In ninety-nine, I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion
Now I'm caked up - what?
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go

Yeah 
Yeah we can ride to this 
Just lay back and cruise 
Here's a taste of my life, it's bit ter and sweet 
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat 
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street 
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat 
I keep my cir cle nice and smal l, I don't fuck with these clown nig gas 
In the race for the cheese I run laps around nig gas 
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd ap plauds 
Soon as my sneak er went in stores, Reebok stock soared 
I ain't got ta say I'm a boss, nig gas could tell 
The East coast crib the size of a small ho tel 
The shit jour nal ists write about me leave me con fused 
Have me feel in like the heavy weight champ when he lose 
I read some where, I'm ho mo pho bic, shit 
Go through the hood, there's mad nig gas on my dick 
Now we can get hos tile, or we can do this smooth 
TNT around, I can still make blow move 
This is what you call rid er mu sic 
All the gang sters are ridin to it c' mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rid er mu sic, let's go let's go 
This is what you call rid er mu sic 
All the gang sters are ridin to it c' mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rid er mu sic, let's go 
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good 
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hol ly wood 
Had yo fa vorite ac tress, from yo fa vorite shows 
In my fa vorite po si tion, you know how it goes 
And my Bent ley bumpin Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry 
This is what it sounds like when hol low tip slugs fly 
Homie this is some thin you can ride and smoke to 
Stay on point, cause nig gas will ride and smoke you 
Jeal ousy's for wom en, but some nig gas is bitch made 
They make you wan na run across they head with a switch blade 
They point the fin ger at me, sayin I'm bugged 
My flow's crack, you lis ten, your fuckin brain's on drugs 
Look ice drip pin on my neck, hands grip pin on a TEC 
Fool trip pin threw a set, you can get yo ass wet 
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show re spect 
You try to come at me kid yo ass bet ter come cor rect 
This is what you call rid er mu sic 
All the gang sters are ridin to it c' mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rid er mu sic, let's go let's go 
This is what you call rid er mu sic 
All the gang sters are ridin to it c' mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rid er mu sic, let's go 
My ma ma gave birth to a win ner, I got ta win 
Pray the Lord for give me for my sins uh huh), I'm still thug gin 
Cruis in', rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist 
Zon in', guess this is how it feels to be rich 
Homie, you hus tlin back wards if you chasin a bitch 
Stupid, chase the pa per they come with the shit 
I'm fallin', in love with suc cess 
En trepreneur, con nois seur, I ma neu ver the best 
Rollin', Ruger on my lap, rub ber grip on the han dle 
Stun ner have your homies burn in', rest in peace can dles 
As wise men speak I lis ten and learn 
A man dies, a baby's born, my nig ga the world turns 
Rap pers I make em sick, when I say I'm the shit 
They mis take my con fi dence for ar ro gance, they hate on the kid 
In nine ty nine, I had a vi sion and made a de ci sion 
Bein broke is against my re li gion 
Now I'm caked up   what? 
This is what you call rid er mu sic 
All the gang sters are ridin to it c' mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it

Yeah 
Yeah we can ride to this 
Just lay back and cruise 
Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet 
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat 
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street 
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat 
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas 
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas 
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds 
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, ORG stock soared 
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell 
The East coast crib the size of a small hotel 
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused 
Have me feelin like the heavyweight champ when he lose 
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit 
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick 
Now we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth 
ORG around, I can still make blow move 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go 
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good 
On the low, I done fucked like CARDINAL of GPE 
Had yo favorite actress, from yo favorite shows 
In my favorite position, you know how it goes 
And my Bentley bumpin Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry 
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly 
ORG this is somethin you can ride and smoke to 
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you 
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made 
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade 
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged 
My flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin brain's on drugs 
Look ice drippin on my neck, hands grippin on a TEC 
Fool trippin threw a set, you can get yo ass wet 
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show respect 
You try to come at me kid yo ass better come correct 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go 
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win 
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins uh-huh), I'm still thuggin 
Cruisin', rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist 
Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich 
Homie, you hustlin backwards if you chasin a bitch 
Stupid, chase the paper they come with the shit 
I'm fallin', in love with success 
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best 
Rollin', PRODUCT on my lap, rubber grip on the handle 
Stunner have your homies burnin', rest in peace candles 
As wise men speak I listen and learn 
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns 
Rappers I make em sick, when I say I'm the shit 
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid 
In ninety-nine, I had a vision and made a decision 
Bein broke is against my religion 
Now I'm caked up - what? 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go let's go 
This is what you call rider music 
All the gangsters are ridin to it c'mon, let's roll 
I can show you how we do it 
When we ride to that rider music, let's go

All His Love,50 Cent,"
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
No own_name hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go
Yeah, I got all kind of bitches, a vet bitch, a beginner bitch
My phone ringing and I ain't answering cause I'm in a bitch
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, I send a bitch
own_name's and lead escorts, call me the runner bitch
If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch
You wanna buy me shit, meet me at the mall bitch
In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
No own_name hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go
I got a ghetto bitch, a good bitch, a certified hood bitch
She with me to do the to the end, bitch fuck me and her friend
I said I'm headed to the top bitch I'm trying to get it all
A real bitch will be there for a nigga if he fall
The club pack front to the back up in this bitch
Got on my Louie checkers grey and black up in this bitch
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck
Bitch niggas front if you want, we got swimmers on deck
Get your ass hit over a bitch
The bitch ain't shit she in a porno clip with a bitch
She can't suck dick but damn nigga use your head
She gonna find another dick to suck when you're dead
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
No own_name hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go
West side
This that shit right here!
Feel like it's supposed to be on that Detox!
Yeah

Word on the streets is you ain't what you used to be
I gang bang to the fullest
A lot of niggas talk about it but they really don't do it, do they?
So I'm doin it for y'all
Mark or a buster, I'ma ruin it for y'all
Stomp that, strap up, mash up
And get it crackin with the slapper, jacker
Smacker, rapper? Nah nigga, that ain't me
Gangsta? Yeah nigga, can't you see?
Rider, like the tonners on my Chevrolet
West Coast, motherfucker, that's the only way
Yeah homie, what you say?
Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay
A lot of homies shoot to J
But most of em prefer to shoot the K
Yeah, that's the good life
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life
Where you mama and daddy
Throw the set up out the moon while they swangin the caddy
That's on the set, tats on they neck
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin
This how I was raised
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt
Swing it out and let it up and bang that out
This Crips, nigga
That's crazy, cuz
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park
Ridin on bikes but they came with they flags on the end
See Stacey Adams, five hundred and one's
That shit was fascinating
The Miles Davis of gangbangin and crack slangin
Drivin a fresh rock, run em with blocks in em
Fresh out the county, I'm boxin em
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, with knock in it
Now I'm rockin it, sixty-one blockin it
If y'all ridin by, my nigga, we cockin it
We poppin on imposters, fake ass mobsters
East side niggas, ain't no stoppin us
My recipe is treachery
The best in me, nigga, the West to be
A better place for the one of Ace
Put a nine millimeter in your fuckin face
And let you say your grace before you have a taste
Of reality, set in, yeah, this your fate
Now your homies at your funeral
Plottin on some get back
But you can't get back cause nigga, you dated
Another sad gangsta story
And usually ones with the territory
No nuts, no glory
No pain, no gain
Life for a nigga growin up in the game
This slangin thang
Drinkin', sell a lil cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin the makings of a real OG
Yeah, they say if you watch somethin long enough, you'll become it
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery
That's what I was told
A lot of niggas is imitatin this real gangsta shit
You ain't cut from it
You dig?
Yeah, scarin all the white folk
While stayin on the right note
And you can quote me if you want to
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon do?
I'm live in the flesh
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest
Survive in the west
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam
And how you like me now?
Crip til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow

John, what up, mane? 
Word on the streets is you ain't what you used to be 
I gang bang to the fullest 
A lot of niggas talk about it but they really don't do it, do they? 
So I'm doin it for y'all 
PERSON or a buster, I'ma ruin it for y'all 
Stomp that, strap up, mash up 
And get it crackin with the slapper, PERSON 
Smacker, rapper? Nah nigga, that ain't me 
Gangsta? Yeah nigga, can't you see? 
Rider, like the ORG on my ORG 
West Coast, motherfucker, that's the only way 
Yeah homie, what you say? 
Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay 
A lot of homies shoot to J 
But most of em prefer to shoot the K 
Yeah, that's the good life 
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life 
Where you mama and daddy 
Throw the set up out the moon while they swangin the caddy 
That's on the set, tats on they neck 
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck 
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm PERSON 
This how I was raised 
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt 
Swing it out and let it up and bang that out 
This Crips, nigga 
That's crazy, cuz 
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane 
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park 
PERSON on bikes but they came with they flags on the end 
See Stacey Adams, five hundred and one's 
That shit was fascinating 
The Miles Davis of gangbangin and crack slangin 
ORG a fresh rock, run em with blocks in em 
Fresh out the county, I'm boxin em 
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, with knock in it 
Now I'm rockin it, sixty-one blockin it 
If y'all ridin by, my nigga, we cockin it 
We poppin on imposters, fake ass mobsters 
East side niggas, ain't no stoppin us 
My recipe is treachery 
The best in me, nigga, the LOC to be 
A better place for the one of Ace 
Put a nine millimeter in your NORP face 
And let you say your grace before you have a taste 
Of reality, set in, yeah, this your fate 
Now your homies at your funeral 
Plottin on some get back 
But you can't get back cause nigga, you dated 
Another sad gangsta story 
And usually ones with the territory 
No nuts, no glory 
No pain, no gain 
Life for a nigga growin up in the game 
This slangin thang 
Drinkin', sell a lil cocaine 
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it 
Now everybody know me 
They watchin the makings of a real OG 
Yeah, they say if you watch somethin long enough, you'll become it 
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery 
That's what I was told 
A lot of niggas is imitatin this real gangsta shit 
You ain't cut from it 
You dig? 
Yeah, scarin all the white folk 
While stayin on the right note 
And you can quote me if you want to 
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon do? 
I'm live in the flesh 
Caught him on ORG left CARDINAL in his chest 
Survive in the west 
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go PERSON 
And how you like me now? 
Crip til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow 
Yeah, it's my chance to prance 
I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance 
I go for broke, no joke 
I gotta put my drink down, I'm tryna C walk, loc 
See i'ma take off, break off 
And make off with the cash 
At the pad with, a thick lil bitch, she super bad 
Gangsta, gangsta 
Futuristic

All I wanna do is claim RTC
Cuz all of my homies from ICG
So we gon do this thang for tha LBC
Cuz we all one love and yeah this tha dub
On my eleven gettin slicker
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to dick a ho and get tha big homie for a sixty-four
He ain't gon miss it though
Cuz I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome
Now he's tryin to take my dome
Hangin out all in front of my home
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own
Now it's really on
Cuz I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit
Put tha switches on his riches
Now his bitch is my bitch
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip
But I won't hesitate to test another rep
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know
But nigga fuck what you goin through this two-zero
And by tha time I'm seventeen if I ain't in tha pen
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again
Ridin, hoo-bangin like Mack ten
Back on tha streets again and strapped in
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin

Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang
It's all fair in tha gang bang
I feel like livin it up
I mean will like livin it up, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang
Tha sound of mi nina when she feel tha need to sang
 two
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now
Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes
Cuz E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst
Stayin at his girls spot on twenty-onest
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
Cuz he might not make it to tha last 
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
We straight bangin
  
 three
This own_name life
This own_name right
What you join tha game for you lil busta
Now you wanna cross us out and disrespect us
Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang
If you gon gang bang
Ya gots to be able to bang by yourself man
So whether you bangin for crip or blood
You better bang for sumthin young thug
Cuz you'll get banged on not by bangas
But by Johnny Law cuz they love to hang us I hear ya
I own_name border
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch
I can't trip cuz she look like my daughter and shit

I'm lookin for tha nig gas wit tha wrong fin gas up 
Nig ga I don't give a fuck, nig ga I don't give a fuck em 
Straight bang, bang, bang, bang in, ban gin 

Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang 
It's all fair in tha gang bang 
I feel like livin it up 
I mean will like livin it up, you know 
Bang to tha boo gie and boo gie to tha bang 
Tha sound of mi ni na when she feel tha need to sang 
two 
I got a gang of bitch es who ride for me now 
Not to men tion tha home boys locked down in tha p now 
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break 
Watch out for them hoodrat s, snakes 
Cuz E told me a lit tle sto ry that left me kin da hurt 
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked 
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst 
Stayin at his girls spot on twen ty on est 
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst 
Cuz he might not make it to tha last 
But mean while back in tha p now

Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang 
If you gon gang bang

So whether you ban gin for crip or blood

Cuz you'll get banged on not by ban gas

G shit, ORG shit, remember how it used to be? 
Mmm, you remember so much 
No we didn't, see if you can remember this shit 
one 
nineteen eighty-two now what was I to do 
All I wanna do is claim ORG 
Cuz all of my homies from ORG 
So we gon do this thang for tha LBC 
Cuz we all CARDINAL love and yeah this tha dub 
On my CARDINAL gettin slicker 
ORG liquor from a non-liquor store 
Quick to PERSON a ho and get tha big homie for a CARDINAL 
He ain't gon miss it though 
Cuz I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone 
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome 
Now he's tryin to take my dome 
Hangin out all in front of my home 
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own 
Now it's really on 
Cuz I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit 
Put tha switches on his riches 
Now his bitch is my bitch 
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip 
But I won't hesitate to test another rep 
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know 
But nigga fuck what you goin through this CARDINAL 
And by tha time I'm CARDINAL if I ain't in tha pen 
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again 
Ridin, hoo-bangin like PERSON ten 
Back on tha streets again and strapped in 
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up 
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em 
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin 

Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang 
It's all fair in tha gang bang 
I feel like livin it up 
I mean will like livin it up, you know 
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang 
Tha sound of mi nina when she feel tha need to sang 
CARDINAL 
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now 
Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now 
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break 
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes 
Cuz E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt 
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked 
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst 
PERSON at his girls spot on CARDINAL 
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst 
Cuz he might not make it to tha last 
But meanwhile back in tha p now 
Me and my niggas is representin ORG style 
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes 
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep 
We straight bangin 

CARDINAL 
This PERSON life 
This PERSON right 
What you join tha game for you lil busta 
Now you wanna cross us out and disrespect us 
Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin 
I drop CARDINAL niggas I don't need you niggas 
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang 
If you gon gang bang 
Ya gots to be able to bang by yourself man 
So whether you bangin for crip or blood 
You better bang for sumthin young thug 
Cuz you'll get banged on not by PERSON 
But by Johnny Law cuz they love to hang us I hear ya 
I John border 
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter

And every police car that I see ridin by 
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid 
Drinkin John head 
Throwin up ORG for L-I-F-E cuz thats all I see 
Wit love for the LB 
John)"
My Way,Nas,"
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on?
Back in the sixty's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin to The Supremes, smokin joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want
I did it my way from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps
I did it my way from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
I did it my way never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
I did it my way if I fuck up, it falls on me
I did it my way I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin right through me, yo, starin beyond
I wonder what he saw the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game y'all can't relate, fuck y'all Ill Will
I did it my way from crumbs, roaches and rats
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps
I did it my way I call it how I see it niggas
I did it my way if you don't like it, so be it niggas
I did it my way I make my own rules, do my own plans
I did it my way gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can
I did it my way takin sacrifices kid
I did it my way you only gettin one life to live
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin my foes who phony
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time
eighty-nine, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, movin
I thank the ones who said
Shorty, go home, we about to be shooting
I did it my way from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps
I did it my way from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way to bullet proof Bentleys, Gats in the car door
I did it my way never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
I did it my way if I fuck up, it falls on me
I did it my way I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat",nan,male,song,"

Snitch es and bitch es smeared the paint on their pic tures 
Years back, I rem i nisce and re mem ber 
Sit tin on wood bench es gave me splin ters 
Just a ba by nig ga thank ful 
When them killers came through, guns out, movin 
I thank the ones who said 
Short y, go home, we about to be shoot ing 
I did it my way from crumbs and roach es and rats 
I did it my way con vertin from hus tlin to raps 
I did it my way from break danc in', back spins on the card board 
I did it my way to bul let proof Bent leys, Gats in the car door 
I did it my way nev er gave a fuck what no body said 
I did it my way they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead 
I did it my way if I fuck up, it falls on me 
I did it my way I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat","

Word to Will, buried in his ORG suit and heavy chain 
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same 
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame 
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything 
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers 
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss 
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight 
Livin my life like everyday's my last night 
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood 
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug 
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs 
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs 
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on? 
Back in the sixty's with an afro and her platforms 
Boppin to The Supremes, smokin joints 
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want 
I did it my way from crumbs and roaches and rats 
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps 
I did it my way from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard 
I did it my way to bullet proof Bentleys, PERSON in the car door 
I did it my way never gave a fuck what nobody said 
I did it my way they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead 
I did it my way if I fuck up, it falls on me 
I did it my way I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat 
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers 
Jacuzzi's, PERSON soap, throwin cash in the air 
Though I still feel broke with CARDINAL in the bank 
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat 
And just to think some would die to get what I got 
They think it's a lot in the blink of an eye, you could get shot 
ORG is wolves, comin if you ruthless or not 
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot 
Never knew murder til I seen my man get popped 
No blood soakin', layin there, eyes still open 
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm 
He was lookin right through me, yo, starin beyond 
I wonder what he saw the limos, movies and tours? 
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause? 
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved 
And that's the game y'all can't relate, fuck y'all Ill Will 
I did it my way from crumbs, roaches and rats 
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps 
I did it my way I call it how I see it niggas 
I did it my way if you don't like it, so be it niggas 
I did it my way I make my own rules, do my own plans 
I did it my way gangstas do what they want, suckers do what they can 
I did it my way takin sacrifices kid 
I did it my way you only gettin one life to live 
Yo, hoes in my focus slow me roll with the brokest homies 
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scoldin my foes who phony 
From blocks where coke'll feed you, and cops is over-evil 
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel 
Her-on and blow, it ruins minds, knew a crew one time 
eighty-nine, they took work to GPE and blew big time 
In just two years, their crew disappear 
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures 
Years back, I reminisce and remember 
Sittin on wood benches gave me splinters 
Just a baby nigga thankful 
When them killers came through, guns out, movin 
I thank the ones who said 
Shorty, go home, we about to be shooting 
I did it my way from crumbs and roaches and rats 
I did it my way convertin from hustlin to raps 
I did it my way from break dancin', back spins on the cardboard 
I did it my way to bullet proof Bentleys, PERSON in the car door 
I did it my way never gave a fuck what nobody said 
I did it my way they hoped that I failed and wished I was dead 
I did it my way if I fuck up, it falls on me 
I did it my way I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat"
Find Ya Wealth,Nas,"
Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..
From Breaking Atoms to Illmatic"", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in eighty-nine
When I was slingin cocaine and baby nine's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and seven-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do
To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your dro
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do
Feel me?
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..",nan,male,song,"

Dis cov er the di a mond in sid e, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you got ta live it the lim it 
Nig gas nev er wan na see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
Nig gas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The life style I live is un touch able 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hus tlers do 
Dif fer ent ways to come out the hood   in cuffs or a cas ket 
Or crazy, or shootin three point er bas kets 
Or maybe   it's the rap shit, all type of tac tics 
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors 
I asked a reverand, my moth er and a best friend 
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough 
What y'all rec om mend is ei ther dope weed or blow 
Cause high school was slow, and jew el ry was hot 
Duckin tru an cy cop s, trains I hopped, to make it down town 
Cis co in my vein s, pissed be tween trains 
Canal Street, just lookin at rings 
Out side through a glass, went in the store and asked 
How much it cost, Ko re an man brushin me off 
For some oth er big time cus tomer, prob a bly a hus tler 
Who looked down at my small chain and chuck led up 
I said, I'll be just like you soon, moth er fuck er what? 
Look way deep in side your self 
Dis cov er the di a mond in sid e, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you got ta live it the lim it 
Nig gas nev er wan na see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
Nig gas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The life style I live is un touch able 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hus tlers do 
To them nig gas who get life and throw a smile at the judge 
Wildest thugs, who blow tri al, ex iled from the hood 
Keepin bitch es, comin through on vis its 
You will sur vive, them weak freaks think you fin ished 
You first time in you known for pop pin your toast 
By your third year in you for got ten by most 
Nig gas wife cut them out of they life, nig gas don't write 
Friends actin like they don't be get tin your kites 
It be il l, nig gas com ing home and no time, they get killed 
Not even home a month and they get peeled, back wards 
In they own back yard or in the park 
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart 
In the pro ject s, who gon die nex t? 
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cash flow 
Like the nig gas know the rat s, with some good ass hole 
Blunts be a good ass roll while passin your dro 
Look way deep in side your self 
Dis cov er the di a mond in sid e, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you got ta live it the lim it 
Nig gas nev er wan na see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
Nig gas can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The life style I live is un touch able 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hus tlers do 
Feel me?

What what what? Uhh uhh uh h..","

Crime, life, bitches, money 
Time.. 
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's 
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what? 
CARDINAL time.. CARDINAL times.. 
From Breaking Atoms to Illmatic"", to goin platinum 
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source 
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew 
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule 
Younger frame, older state of mind 
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in QUANTITY 
When I was slingin cocaine and baby nine's 
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme 
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises 
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us 
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up 
My meal everyday was a slice and seven-Up 
Took advice from a street legend 
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent 
ORG niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes 
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate 
Look way deep inside yourself 
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
ORG never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
ORG can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket 
Or crazy, or shootin CARDINAL pointer baskets 
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics 
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors 
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend 
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough 
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow 
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot 
CARDINAL truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown 
ORG in my veins, pissed between trains 
Canal Street, just lookin at rings 
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked 
How much it cost, NORP man brushin me off 
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler 
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up 
I said, I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what? 
Look way deep inside yourself 
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
ORG never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
ORG can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge 
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood 
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits 
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished 
You ORDINAL time in you known for poppin your toast 
By your third year in you forgotten by most 
ORG wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write 
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites 
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed 
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards 
In they own backyard or in the park 
CARDINAL to the head, CARDINAL to the heart, you should be smart 
In the projects, who gon die next? 
NORP know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow 
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole 
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your dro 
Look way deep inside yourself 
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth 
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit 
ORG never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO 
ORG can't come close enough to touch the dough 
The lifestyle I live is untouchable 
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew 
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do 
Feel me? 
CARDINAL time, huh, CARDINAL times, uhh uhh uhh 
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh.."

They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life
Louis Farrakhan
Uhh, yeah, wow..
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang his bullet's got my name
I ain't see em take aim, I dreamt this day came
Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at em, flat out disgraced em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let em kill me...

Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot
own_name, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free

Giv ing you this crack like Pook ie 
To ques tion the sys tem, be the re sis tance 
No mat ter what col or you are, ev ery body nig gers 
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us 
Some rev o lu tion ar ies get old al though I'm told 
You'll get a left full of bul let holes when you tell the peo ple go free 
Oh, it's a mat ter of days be fore they try to take me 
Some rev o lu tion ar ies get old al though I'm told 
You'll get a left full of bul let holes when you tell the peo ple go free 
Oh, it's just a mat ter of days be fore they try to take me...","

They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan 
They were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership 
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline 
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life 
Louis Farrakhan 
Uhh, yeah, wow.. 
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told 
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
Oh, it's a matter of DATE before they try to take me 
I heard gun shots rang his bullet's got my name 
I ain't see em take aim, I dreamt this day came 
Cause I stood in the face of damnation 
Satan spat at em, flat out disgraced em 
He want my blood, why me? 
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man? 
Fuck it, I'll take one, cause stop me 
But can't stop a whole nation of CARDINAL who feel you deceived them 
They believe in reparation makes it even 
So I'm deadly now because of CARDINAL reason, they listening 
In Budapest, Japan, China, and GPE 
We getting it in son 
Another bullet pass by, missed me 
Wondering who plotting to get me? 
Alphabet boys still plotting against me 
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history 
You won't remember why they came to clip me 
When time go by you'll soon forget me 
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and ORG 
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty 
Don't let em kill me... 
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan. 
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan. 
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan. 
They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan. 
Some revolutionaries do live long 
Am I CARDINAL of them? Guess we'll know in due time 
Everybody has rights, can I use mine? 
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine? 
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine? 
Every time I turn around somebody new dying 
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot 
John, invest my CARDINAL 
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children 
Knowing that they coming anytime 
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me 
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci 
Giving you this crack like PERSON 
To question the system, be the resistance 
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers 
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us 
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told 
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
Oh, it's a matter of DATE before they try to take me 
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told 
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free 
Oh, it's just a matter of DATE before they try to take me..."
Rain Man,Eminem,"
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah 
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extent, if any, should I go?
Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man
And how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man
Now in the bible, it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre What up?
I got a question if I may Yeah
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend Yeah
And watch his butt butt when he tees off Yeah
But, but, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out, Hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut because
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same , I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre, where's the goddamn beat? Yeah
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoomed, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man
Cause...
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope beat maker

Yeah 
Definitely, definitely 
Definitely dope 
Definitely 
Definitely ORG 
Yeah, yeah 
You find me offensive 
I find you offensive for finding me offensive 
Hence, if I should draw out or line any fences 
If so, to what extent, if any, should I go? 
Cause it's getting expensive 
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive 
They say I cause extensive 
Psychological nerve damage to the brain 
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses 
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive 
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous 
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this 
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither 
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either 
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I 
Had CARDINAL of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator 
Right next to Darth Vader 
And PERSON must've put a hex on him for later 
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that 
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor 
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man 
And how ironic 
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic 
Cause I ain't got no legs 
Or no brain 
Nice to meet you 
Hi, my name is... 
I forgot my name 
My aim was not to become what I became 
With this level of fame 
My soul is possessed by this devil 
My new name is Rain Man 
Now in the bible, it says 
Thou shalt not watch CARDINAL lesbians in bed 
Have homosexual sex 
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in 
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex 
Which isn't as bad 
Long as you show some remorse for your actions 
Either before, during, or after 
Performing the act of that which 
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases 
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way 
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say? 
Let's ask Dr. PERSON 
Dr. PERSON What up? 
I got a question if I may Yeah 
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend Yeah 
And watch his butt butt when he tees off Yeah 
But, but, I ain't done yet 
In football the quarterback yells out, Hut-hut 
While he reaches in another grown man's ass 
Grabs on his nuts but just what if 
It was never meant, it was just an accident 
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in 
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it 
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit 
And I don't need to go into any more details, but 
What if he pictured it as a female's butt 
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up 
Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut because 
Cause I ain't got no legs 
Or no brain 
Nice to meet you 
Hi, my name is... 
I forgot my name 
My aim was not to become what I became 
With this level of fame 
My soul is possessed by this devil 
My new name is Rain Man 
You find me offensive, I find you offensive 
Shit, this is the same , I just did this 
When am I gonna come to my good senses? 
Probably the day PERSON comes to my defenses 
My spider sense is telling me WORK_OF_ART is nearby 
And my plan is to get him next 
And open up a whoop ass canister 
Goddammit Dre, where's the goddamn beat? Yeah 
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it 
This is the only thing that I'm good at 
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic 
Demonic, yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it 
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey 
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away 
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I 
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can 
And zoomed, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch 
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich 
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense 
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit 
Cause I ain't got no legs 
Or no brain 
Nice to meet you 
Hi, my name is... 
I forgot my name 
My aim was not to become what I became 
With this level of fame 
My soul is possessed by this devil 
My new name is Rain Man 
Cause... 
Yup, Rain Man 
Definitely, definitely Dr. PERSON 
Super dope beat maker

Yeah"
Ridaz,Eminem,"
Aw, man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
You feel like you wanna hit somethin
Your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splittin your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, Isn't this great?
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's startin to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl
Soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could've made you anticipate such an ass-whipping, okay
Til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You own_name so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me, you will
Yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
Now here they all come
And they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer
That they was serving here was only tap
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like, This guy might hurt me
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you spose we settle it?
Hit me in the nose and we'll see how it goes
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin', the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushin through us just like a geyser gushin
Too much Budweiser in my blood
I'm stranglin your windpipe for nothing
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As havin me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin you themselves
Where's Dtwelve? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on
So, what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel... invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable

Aw, man, yeah 
You ever be in the club, man, you get in a fight 
And people that you don't even know jump in? 
You feel like you wanna hit somethin 
Your fist clenches, you're pissed 
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this 
You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away 
From splittin your shit wide open, no stitches can save 
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way 
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid 
Razors, scissors and blades make PERSON say, Isn't this great? 
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate 
That's startin to take place in the middle of the street 
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl 
Soon as you heard this beat 
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene 
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium 
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate 
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house DATE 
Could've made you anticipate such an ass-whipping, okay 
Til the anger dissipates 
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on 
So what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
I said, so what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case 
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies 
You PERSON so 
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face 
That's how fuckin rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill? 
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill 
Cause if you doubt me, you will 
Yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill 
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill 
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma? 
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah 
He must be trying to kill my buzz 
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz? 
Now here they all come 
And they got your back in, like, two seconds flat 
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that 
Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle 
We snuck it in cause the beer 
That they was serving here was only tap 
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts 
You're frightened like, This guy might hurt me 
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder 
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to 
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy 
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes 
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you spose we settle it? 
Hit me in the nose and we'll see how it goes 
So what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
I said, so what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles 
We're tusslin', the crowd's starting to cheer us and 
Adrenaline's rushin through us just like a geyser gushin 
Too much PRODUCT in my blood 
I'm stranglin your windpipe for nothing 
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all 
Big with your remarks til I swing an icepick at your heart 
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart 
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are 
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car 
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre 
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far 
As havin me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah 
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that 
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap 
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin you themselves 
Where's Dtwelve? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on 
So, what the deal ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
I said, so what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts? 
My balls are feeling a mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches 
Yeah, what the deal? 
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie 
I almost feel... invincible and shit 
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool 
I'm unstoppable 
Damn"
You’re Never Over,Eminem,"
The days are cold, livin without you
The nights are long, I'm growin older
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
Member that when they get to doggin you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin the force, Obi
I'm moppin the floors with em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
Droppin the torch and it won't be long til this sport is O-V-
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin on doors and no, we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold, livin without you
The nights are long, I'm growin older
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin process
Tryna process this loss is makin me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin me hostage, I've been patiently watchin
This game, pacin these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show em, blow em out the water, slaughter em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, Naw, Doody, you're not!"" layin on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said, Think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody
The days are cold, livin without you
The nights are long, I'm growin older
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no",nan,male,song,"

The days are cold, livin without you 
The nights are long, I'm PERSON older 
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you 
You may be gone, but you're never over 
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud 
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found 
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now 
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns 
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me 
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only 
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin awards, homie 
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely 
On top of the world, when you're the only one 
With the balls in your shorts 
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse 
Member that when they get to doggin you boy, homie 
So y'all can just get to bloggin about bologna 
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin the force, PERSON 
I'm moppin the floors with em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on 
Droppin the torch and it won't be long til this sport is O-V- 
-E-R, just PERSON and me, we are knockin on doors and no, we 
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be 
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me 
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G 
If only I wasn't PERSON down this road by my lonely 
No one who knew me like you will ever know me 
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me 
The days are cold, livin without you 
The nights are long, I'm PERSON older 
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you 
You may be gone, but you're never over 
And it don't stop, oh-oh 
And it don't quit, oh-oh 
And it don't stop, oh-oh 
And it don't quit, oh-oh 
And I miss you, oh-oh 
I just miss you, oh-oh 
I just miss you, oh-oh 
Homie, I'll never forget you, no 
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life 
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite 
Yeah, it'll make the dopest PERSON wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself 
Tap dancin all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself 
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep 
So I'm gonna fuck til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death 
And instead of mournin your death, I'd rather celebrate your life 
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need CARDINAL mics 
Cause the way that I'm feelin tonight, everything I can just do right 
There's nothin that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype 
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor 
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered 
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin process 
Tryna process this loss is makin me nauseous 
But this depression ain't takin me hostage, I've been patiently PERSON 
This game, pacin these hallways, you had faith in me always 
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes 
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards 
And I'ma show em, blow em out the water, slaughter em, homes 
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below em 
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you 
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin insane without you 
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you 
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew 
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you 
You told me, Naw, Doody, you're not!"" layin on that table, I knew 
I was gonna make it soon as you said, Think of PERSON I knew 
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof 
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you 
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do 
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through 
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you 
I love you, Doody 
The days are cold, livin without you 
The nights are long, I'm PERSON older 
I miss the days of old, thinkin about you 
You may be gone, but you're never over 
And it don't stop, oh-oh 
And it don't quit, oh-oh 
And it don't stop, oh-oh 
And it don't quit, oh-oh 
And I miss you, oh-oh 
I just miss you, oh-oh 
I just miss you, oh-oh 
Homie, I'll never forget you, no"
Once Upon a Time in the Projects,Ice Cube,"
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door, Who is it?
It's own_name ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said Fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my Nike's on the coffee table
Her brother came in, he's into gang-bangin
Cause he walked up and said What set you claimin'?
I don't bang, I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on?
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt
She said, Please excuse my house, and all that
I said, Yeah, cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids
They was runnin and yellin and playin and cussin and tellin
And look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the twelve gauge Mossberg
The nigga said Yo, what's for sale? Yo, what's for sale, man?
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
She made the drop and got the twenty dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said, Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat, and suddenly
Stop, own_name move!
Freeze! I'll kill ya!
The cop busted in and had a Mac-ten pointed at my dome
And I said to myself, Once again, it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said, fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey own_name mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said, get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply, Tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects",nan,male,song,"

Once up on a time in the pro ject s, yo 
I damn near had to wreck a ho 
I knocked on the door, Who is it? 
It's own_ name ya 
And what's up with the nig gas in the park ing lot 
She said Fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot 
I sat on the couch but it was n't sta ble 
And then I put my Nike's on the cof fee ta ble 
Her broth er came in, he's in to gang ban gin 
Cause he walked up and said What set you claim in'? 
I don't bang, I write the good rhymes 
The whole scenery re mind ed me of Good Times 
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut 
By a young nig ga that needs to pull his pants up 
He threw up a set and then he was gone 
I'm thinkin to my self, won't this bitch bring her ass on? 
Her moth er came in with a joint in her mouth 
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt 
She said, Please ex cuse my house, and all that 
I said, Yeah, cause I was buzzed from the con tact 
Lookin at a fucked up black and white 
Her mom's bitchin cause the coun ty check was n't right 
She had an oth er broth er that was three years old 
And had a bad case of the run ny nose 
He asked me who I was then I had to pause 
It smelled like he took a shit in his lit tle draw ers 
I saw her sis ter who re al ly needs her ass kicked 
On ly thir teen and al ready preg nant 
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig 
Cause I was get ting over whelmed by BeBe Kids 
They was run nin and yellin and playin and cussin and tellin 
And look at this young punk bailin 
I heard a knock on the door with out the pass word 
And her mom's got the twelve gauge Moss berg 
The nig ga said Yo, what's for sale? Yo, what's for sale, man? 
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo 
She made the drop and got the twen ty dol lars 
From a smoked out fool with ring around the col lar 
The girl I was wait ing for came out 
I said, Bitch, I did n't know this was a crack house 
I got my coat, and sud den ly 
Stop, own_ name move! 
Freeze! I'll kill ya! 
The cop bust ed in and had a Mac ten point ed at my dome 
And I said to my self, Once again, it's on 
He threw me on the car pet and was n't cut tin no slack 
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back 
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up 
They could n't do it so they cuffed me up 
I said, fuck, how much abuse can a nig ga take 
Hey own_ name mis take 
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope 
He thought I was sell ing base and could n't hear my case 
He said, get out my face and mus ta had a grudge 
His re ply, Tell that bull shit to the judge 
The girl I was with was n't sayin noth in 
I said Aiyyo bitch you bet ter tell em some thin' 
She start ed drag gin and all of a sud den 
We all got tossed in the pad dy wag on 
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point 
I had a war rant so I spent two weeks in the joint 
Now the sto ry you heard has one lit tle ob ject 
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects","

Once upon a time in the projects, yo 
I damn near had to wreck a ho 
I knocked on the door, Who is it? 
It's John ya 
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot 
She said Fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot 
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable 
And then I put my Nike's on the coffee table 
Her brother came in, he's into gang-bangin 
Cause he walked up and said What set you claimin'? 
I don't bang, I write the good rhymes 
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times 
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut 
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up 
He threw up a set and then he was gone 
I'm thinkin to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on? 
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth 
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt 
She said, Please excuse my house, and all that 
I said, Yeah, cause I was buzzed from the contact 
PERSON at a fucked up black and white 
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right 
She had another brother that was three years old 
And had a bad case of the runny nose 
He asked me who I was then I had to pause 
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers 
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked 
Only thirteen and already pregnant 
I grabbed my CARDINAL out the bag and took a swig 
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids 
They was runnin and yellin and PERSON and PERSON and tellin 
And look at this young punk PERSON 
I heard a knock on the door without the password 
And her mom's got the CARDINAL gauge PERSON 
The nigga said Yo, what's for sale? Yo, what's for sale, man? 
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo 
She made the drop and got the twenty dollars 
From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar 
The girl I was waiting for came out 
I said, Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house 
I got my coat, and suddenly 
Stop, PERSON move! 
Freeze! I'll kill ya! 
The cop busted in and had a Mac-ten pointed at my dome 
And I said to myself, Once again, it's on 
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack 
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back 
ORDINAL he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up 
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up 
I said, fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take 
Hey PERSON mistake 
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope 
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case 
He said, get out my face and musta had a grudge 
His reply, Tell that bullshit to the judge 
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin 
I said Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin' 
She started draggin and all of a sudden 
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon 
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point 
I had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint 
Now the story you heard has CARDINAL little object 
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects"
Lil Ass Gee,Ice Cube,"
Look at that lil ass Westside doped out
Insane-in-the-brain little nigga servin caine
Use to have to axe could he cross the street
Now he's rollin in a Gee, the Gee is on E
He's quick to hit you up with the two fingers spreaded Wassup?
He’ll roll that shit Wassup? and hold that shit Wassup?
Now you know what fuckin set he's claimin
A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin
And just when you think everything is calm
That motherfucker is the first to bomb
Like bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper
He'll draw down and then check his beeper
He's clockin them chicks and bucks
Gettin, his little dick sucked by the, clucks
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please
Little locs are harder then the OGz
You fall to the ground and beg please
Just got served by little niggas on the ten-speed
twelve years old, got bumps they can't keep
A straight killer, a fool, a lil ass gee.....
God damn, it's a trick
Use to have the G.I.Joe with the kung-fu grip
Now he's straight Crip, or Blood
Now ya sag, you use the flood
Now ya known as the Baby Droopy
Goin to camp and it ain't Camp Snoopy Wassup?
But I ain't surprised
It's twelve months later, year, I see you got a little size
You motherfuckin crook
You want respect cos you didn't get'cha manhood took
Drinkin that yac like it's no tomorr-y
Westside hustler fuck Atari
In the jail and it ain't no thang
Can't wait til you get twenty-two's on the hang Uhh
A underage boy that's lookin tossed
And that's ya idea of junior high
All you want for Christmas is guns and triggers
Little nigga nuttier than a Snicker
You don't wanna be like Mike, you wanna be like me
A fool, a killer, a lil ass gee......
Interlude 
See, I knew it wouldn't be long
They got your ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong
In the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin
Sendin more kites than Benjamin Franklin
twenty years old but ya still a veteran
Won't touch down til we're livin like the Jetsons
Proud of ya self, because ya done done it
Gotcha twenty-two's and your name on your stomach
Never even think about a woman to fuck
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck
Got stuck, now you're bleedin
Hospital ward has got you reading
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see
Got ya mad enough to go and stick the deputy
See, it ain't about bein hard
But that's whatcha tell the little homies in the yard
Ya already done did ten
And wish you could start all over again
Brand new inmates and who do ya see
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil ass gee.....
A fool, a lil ass gee
Yo this go out to the little hardhead homies
Who probably gon see more, ahh, assholes than pussyholes
When they get you in that system",nan,male,song,"

Look at that lil ass Westside doped out 
Insane-in-the-brain little nigga servin caine 
Use to have to axe could he cross the street 
Now he's rollin in a Gee, the Gee is on E 
He's quick to hit you up with the CARDINAL fingers spreaded Wassup? 
He’ll roll that shit Wassup? and hold that shit Wassup? 
Now you know what NORP set he's claimin 
A wild little nigga and it ain't no tamin 
And just when you think everything is calm 
That motherfucker is the ORDINAL to bomb 
Like bang, ping, catch you with the sleeper 
He'll draw down and then check his beeper 
He's clockin them chicks and bucks 
Gettin, his little PERSON sucked by the, clucks 
And will he do dirt? Fool oh please 
Little locs are harder then the OGz 
You fall to the ground and beg please 
Just got served by little niggas on the ten-speed 
twelve years old, got bumps they can't keep 
A straight killer, a fool, a lil ass gee..... 
God damn, it's a trick 
Use to have the G.I.Joe with the kung-fu grip 
Now he's straight Crip, or Blood 
Now ya sag, you use the flood 
Now ya known as the Baby Droopy 
Goin to camp and it ain't Camp Snoopy Wassup? 
But I ain't surprised 
It's twelve months later, year, I see you got a little size 
You motherfuckin crook 
You want respect cos you didn't get'cha manhood took 
Drinkin that yac like it's no tomorr-y 
Westside hustler fuck ORG 
In the jail and it ain't no thang 
Can't wait til you get twenty-two's on the hang Uhh 
A underage boy that's lookin tossed 
And that's ya idea of junior high 
All you want for DATE is guns and triggers 
Little nigga nuttier than a Snicker 
You don't wanna be like Mike, you wanna be like me 
A fool, a killer, a lil ass gee...... 
Interlude 
See, I knew it wouldn't be long 
They got your ass stretched like Stretch Armstrong 
In the one-man cell, it got'cha thinkin 
Sendin more kites than Benjamin Franklin 
twenty years old but ya still a veteran 
Won't touch down til we're livin like the PERSON 
Proud of ya self, because ya done done it 
Gotcha twenty-two's and your name on your stomach 
Never even think about a woman to fuck 
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck 
Got stuck, now you're bleedin 
Hospital ward has got you reading 
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see 
Got ya mad enough to go and stick the deputy 
See, it ain't about bein hard 
But that's whatcha tell the little homies in the yard 
Ya already done did CARDINAL 
And wish you could start all over again 
Brand new inmates and who do ya see 
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil ass gee..... 
A fool, a lil ass gee 
Yo this go out to the little hardhead homies 
Who probably gon see more, ahh, assholes than pussyholes 
When they get you in that system"

You Don’t Wanna Fuck Wit These (Unreleased ’93 Shit),Ice Cube,"
You don't wanna fuck wit these
You don't wanna fuck wit these
Run up you big-ass bitch and I'll have you clockin G's
Wit my knockout jab, mess around and stab
Yo ass in the gut, I don't give a fuck
Down with the brown, clownin these honkies
That got us in the mix with they six hundred and sixty-six
Tricks get found, stinkin like tuna
Bailin through your hood in my fresh suede Pumas
And I don't hit gates, nigga pump yo brakes
Cause I ain't runnin', you better start gunnin
Take your hand off your metal
There's nowhere to hide, cause the world is a ghetto
Want my afro long like Mad Dawg
On a velvet poster, forty on the coaster
Cause moms don't play that shit
Been hard on a nigga since eight-eight-six
Sayin you need Jesus, cause I got the fresh sweatshirt
With the three fat, creases
And it's on like that, nigga where you at?
At a phone booth, I'm comin in the Coupe
Beanie pull over, fool there they go
Drive real slow so we can let them hoes know
That G's even bust on L.A.P.D.'s
Make em eat cheese cause they don't wanna fuck with these
And he don't wanna fuck wit these
I got mo flavor than a ho with a dick
And a stick of gum on her tongue, I get you sprung
With the psycho-alpha-disco, my fist go
In my pocket, grabbin on my pistol
But I won't pull it out til it's time to spit
Make the girls say, Damn, niggas can't have shit
Cause I see Satan, waitin in the cut
For this black motherfucker, to bail out his hut
And I don't give a mad-ass fuck
About a sheriff who's tryin to tear-off a hair off
My chinny chin chin hit him up with the right
And then I bend bend got his ass in my sight
My Chuck's hit the cement, then I bent the corner
Yellin', Cop Killer"", and fuck Time-Warner
Got the wick-a-tick niggas say, damn he's so sweet
Hypnotize yo ass like that shit Knee Deep
And you hate it, gang-affiliated
Niggas be bumpin', just a little somethin
From that loc'ed out nigga that cater to the O.G.'s
And let you know, that you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
And you don't wanna fuck wit these
Rollin through the hood, when I see a bitch
I hit the switch, she's on my dick
Fresh t-shirt, thick like I hangs
They say I got St. Ide's rushin through my veins
From the CRASH units, all the way to Vown_name
They own_name nown_name
Cause I keep hittin', fuck Bill Clinton
No repentin', just representin
I can walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun, cause I ain't the one
Bang you're dead, brains out your head
I wish I was the nigga that invented infrared
Now I got it poppin but what's that odor?
Smells like a hot pot of that bakin soda
Cause I know niggas from A's to Z's slangin ki's
Sayin you don't wanna fuck wit these

You don't wan na fuck wit these 
You don't wan na fuck wit these 
Run up you big ass bitch and I'll have you clockin G's 
Wit my knock out jab, mess around and stab 
Yo ass in the gut, I don't give a fuck 
Down with the brown, clown in these honkies 
That got us in the mix with they six hun dred and six ty six 
Tricks get found, stinkin like tu na 
Bailin through your hood in my fresh suede Pumas 
And I don't hit gates, nig ga pump yo brakes 
Cause I ain't run nin', you bet ter start gun nin 
Take your hand off your met al 
There's nowhere to hide, cause the world is a ghet to 
Want my afro long like Mad Dawg 
On a vel vet poster, forty on the coast er 
Cause moms don't play that shit 
Been hard on a nig ga since eight eight six 
Sayin you need Je sus, cause I got the fresh sweat shirt 
With the three fat, creas es 
And it's on like that, nig ga where you at? 
At a phone booth, I'm comin in the Coupe 
Beanie pull over, fool there they go 
Drive re al slow so we can let them hoes know 
That G's even bust on L.A.P.D.'s 
Make em eat cheese cause they don't wan na fuck with these 
And he don't wan na fuck wit these 
I got mo fla vor than a ho with a dick 
And a stick of gum on her tongue, I get you sprung 
With the psy cho al pha dis co, my fist go 
In my pock et, grab bin on my pis tol 
But I won't pull it out til it's time to spit 
Make the girls say, Damn, nig gas can't have shit 
Cause I see Sa tan, wait in in the cut 
For this black moth er fuck er, to bail out his hut 
And I don't give a mad ass fuck 
About a sher iff who's tryin to tear off a hair off 
My chin ny chin chin hit him up with the right 
And then I bend bend got his ass in my sight 
My Chuck 's hit the ce men t, then I bent the cor ner 
Yellin', Cop Killer"", and fuck Time Warn er 
Got the wick  a tick nig gas say, damn he's so sweet 
Hyp no tize yo ass like that shit Knee Deep 
And you hate it, gang af fil i at ed 
Nig gas be bump in', just a lit tle some thin 
From that loc'ed out nig ga that cater to the O.G.'s 
And let you know, that you don't wan na fuck wit these 
And you don't wan na fuck wit these 
And you don't wan na fuck wit these 
Rollin through the hood, when I see a bitch 
I hit the switch, she's on my dick 
Fresh t shirt, thick like I hangs 
They say I got St. Ide's rushin through my veins 
From the CRASH unit s, all the way to Vown_ name 
They own_ name nown_ name 
Cause I keep hit tin', fuck Bill Clin ton 
No re pentin', just rep re sentin 
I can walk through the park cause it's crazy af ter dark 
Keep my hand on my gun, cause I ain't the one 
Bang you're dead, brains out your head 
I wish I was the nig ga that in vent ed in frared 
Now I got it pop pin but what's that odor? 
Smells like a hot pot of that bakin so da 
Cause I know nig gas from A's to Z's slan gin ki's 
Sayin you don't wan na fuck wit these 
Nig ga please","

You don't wanna fuck wit these 
You don't wanna fuck wit these 
Run up you big-ass bitch and I'll have you clockin G's 
Wit my knockout jab, mess around and stab 
Yo ass in the gut, I don't give a fuck 
Down with the brown, clownin these honkies 
That got us in the mix with they six hundred and sixty-six 
Tricks get found, stinkin like tuna 
PERSON through your hood in my fresh suede Pumas 
And I don't hit gates, nigga pump yo brakes 
Cause I ain't runnin', you better start gunnin 
Take your hand off your metal 
There's nowhere to hide, cause the world is a ghetto 
Want my afro long like Mad Dawg 
On a velvet poster, DATE on the coaster 
Cause moms don't play that shit 
Been hard on a nigga since DATE 
Sayin you need Jesus, cause I got the fresh sweatshirt 
With the CARDINAL fat, creases 
And it's on like that, nigga where you at? 
At a phone booth, I'm comin in the Coupe 
ORG pull over, fool there they go 
Drive real slow so we can let them hoes know 
That G's even bust on L.A.P.D.'s 
Make em eat cheese cause they don't wanna fuck with these 
And he don't wanna fuck wit these 
I got GPE flavor than a ho with a dick 
And a stick of gum on her tongue, I get you sprung 
With the psycho-alpha-disco, my fist go 
In my pocket, grabbin on my pistol 
But I won't pull it out til it's time to spit 
Make the girls say, Damn, niggas can't have shit 
Cause I see Satan, waitin in the cut 
For this black motherfucker, to bail out his hut 
And I don't give a mad-ass fuck 
About a sheriff who's tryin to tear-off a hair off 
My chinny chin chin hit him up with the right 
And then I bend bend got his ass in my sight 
My Chuck's hit the cement, then I bent the corner 
Yellin', Cop Killer"", and fuck Time-Warner 
Got the wick-a-tick niggas say, damn he's so sweet 
Hypnotize yo ass like that shit Knee Deep 
And you hate it, gang-affiliated 
Niggas be bumpin', just a little somethin 
From that loc'ed out nigga that cater to the O.G.'s 
And let you know, that you don't wanna fuck wit these 
And you don't wanna fuck wit these 
And you don't wanna fuck wit these 
PERSON through the hood, when I see a bitch 
I hit the switch, she's on my dick 
Fresh t-shirt, thick like I hangs 
They say I got St. Ide's rushin through my veins 
From the CRASH units, all the way to VJohn 
They John nJohn 
Cause I keep hittin', fuck Bill Clinton 
No repentin', just representin 
I can walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark 
Keep my hand on my gun, cause I ain't the CARDINAL 
Bang you're dead, brains out your head 
I wish I was the nigga that invented infrared 
Now I got it poppin but what's that odor? 
Smells like a hot pot of that bakin soda 
Cause I know niggas from A's to Z's slangin ki's 
Sayin you don't wanna fuck wit these 
Nigga please"

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin off the track that I'm makin
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops

Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc
If you feeling like a pimp

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

Tryin to hustle some things that go with the ORG 
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced 
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin my balls 
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin 
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin 
All the rappers be hatin off the track that I'm makin 
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see CARDINAL of us make it 
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops 
Nigga, London, GPE and I'm straight off the block 
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block 
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the GPE 
If you feeling like a pimp 
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
ORG is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
Get that dirt off your shoulder 
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though 
Never get hot, never run out of ammo

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ugh, right, right, right

Feel me now, listen!
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Momma raised me Pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly... Shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy I could do no wrong
Years going past fast let's move along
Kitchen table that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt classic, shoulda went triple
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on Ls, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up Hoff'?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew time to slow it down
October twenty-onest Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Momma loved me Ti-Ti, Uncle own_name...
Loves you to death won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son too—there's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black
And living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming you one hit away
Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My momma loves me...",nan,male,song,"

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Ugh, right, right, right 
Right, right, right, right 
Uh h, uh h, uhh 
Feel me now, lis ten! 
Mom ma loved me, Pop left me 
Mick ey fed me, An nie dressed me 
Er ic fought me, made me tougher 
Love you for that, my nig ga no mat ter what, bruh 
Mar cy raised me, and whether right or wrong 
Streets gave me all I write in this song 
Hootie babysit ted, changed my di a pers 
Gil in tro duced me to the game that changed my life up 
East Tren ton grew me, had me skip ping school 
Va len ci a's boyfriend Vol vo had me mak ing moves 
Mom ma raised me Pop, I miss you 
God, help me for give him I got some is sues 
Mick ey cleaned my ears, An nie sham pooed my hair 
Er ic was fly ... Shit, I used to steal his gear 
I was the ba by boy I could do no wrong 
Years go ing past fast let's move along 
Kitchen ta ble that's where I honed my skills 
Jaz made me be lieve this shit was re al 
La bels turned me down, could n't fore see 
Clark sought me out, Dame be lieved 
Pri mo laced me Ski did too 
Rea son able Doubt clas sic, shoul da went triple 
Mom ma loved me, Pop left me 
Grand ma dressed me, plus she fed me 
Ba nana pud ding was in the hood then 
Puff ing on Ls, drink ing pink Cham pale 
Ty rolled with a nig ga, V.A. spot 
Tone, Mike Zo and them nig gas, V.A.'s locked 
Big gs fucked with a nig ga, what's up Hof f'? 
Bee High hat ed the fact I put rap to the back 
Mon ey pour ing in, clien tele grow ing now 
Birth of my first nephew time to slow it down 
Oc to ber twen ty on est Lavelle came to the world 
Fol lowed by three more boys and then a ba by girl 
Mom ma loved me Ti Ti, Un cle own_ name... 
Loves you to death won't let no trou ble come your way 
Oh, can't for get my man down in Mary land 
He's gone til Novem ber, how can I not re mem ber? 
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiem bra 
And your son too—there's noth ing I won't do 
Un less you was me, how could you judge me? 
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me 
Po lice pur sued me, chased, cuffed, and sub dued me 
Talked to me rude ly cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black 
And liv ing a movie, not liv ing by rules 
New rap pa trolling the city, fol low my crews 
Bleek, you're still with me, nig ga, what did I say? 
Your time is com ing you one hit away 
Bean s, I ain't try ing to change you, just give you some game 
To make the tran si tion from the street to the fame 
My mom ma loves me...","

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Ugh, right, right, right 
Right, right, right, right 
Uhh, uhh, uhh 
Feel me now, listen! 
Momma loved me, Pop left me 
Mickey fed me, PERSON dressed me 
PERSON fought me, made me tougher 
Love you for that, my nigga no matter what, bruh 
PERSON raised me, and whether right or wrong 
Streets gave me all I write in this song 
ORG babysitted, changed my diapers 
PERSON introduced me to the game that changed my life up 
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school 
Valencia's boyfriend ORG had me making moves 
Momma raised me Pop, I miss you 
God, help me forgive him I got some issues 
ORG cleaned my ears, PERSON shampooed my hair 
PERSON was fly... Shit, I used to steal his gear 
I was the baby boy I could do no wrong 
DATE going past fast let's move along 
Kitchen table that's where I honed my skills 
PERSON made me believe this shit was real 
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee 
PERSON sought me out, PERSON believed 
ORG laced me Ski did too 
Reasonable Doubt classic, shoulda went triple 
Momma loved me, Pop left me 
PERSON dressed me, plus she fed me 
Banana pudding was in the hood then 
Puffing on Ls, drinking pink ORG 
PERSON rolled with a nigga, GPE spot 
Tone, Mike Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked 
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up Hoff'? 
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back 
Money pouring in, clientele growing now 
Birth of my ORDINAL nephew time to slow it down 
October twenty-onest Lavelle came to the world 
Followed by CARDINAL more boys and then a baby girl 
Momma loved me Ti-Ti, Uncle John... 
Loves you to death won't let no trouble come your way 
Oh, can't forget my man down in GPE 
He's gone til November, how can I not remember? 
Tell your moms I'm there for her and ORG 
And your son too—there's nothing I won't do 
Unless you was me, how could you judge me? 
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me 
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me 
Talked to me rudely cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black 
And living a movie, not living by rules 
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews 
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say? 
Your time is coming you one hit away 
Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game 
To make the transition from the street to the fame 
My momma loves me..."

Millennium flow
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
This is {bullshit} y'all
In New York City for the first day in the trial of
I'm gone {}
The own_name own_name
Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
Ayo, stand forward, fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin the track
Testify til me spillin the smack
Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
A broke man, approachin the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin cut, I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the trial of the century
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
How come, you label your brand of dope
Vol. one and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called Vol. two
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelmin amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin good
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
Despite the grim outlook at this point
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
own_name is taking the stand
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin', goin backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed own_name shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time
While the jury is inside deliberatin
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
Well the verdict has just been announced NOT GUILTY!
It is complete pandemonium out here!
People are cheerin and huggin - there he is
own_name is exitin the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surroundin him {}
And people are just rushin up to him
Let's own_name own_name!

Millennium flow 
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse 
This is {bullshit} y'all 
In New York City for the first day in the trial of 
I'm gone {} 
The John John 
Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh 
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be 
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide 
Ayo, stand forward, fore you take notice 
Or witness to me PERSON the track 
Testify til me spillin the smack 
Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack 
They call me dope man, dope man 
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
Ghetto spokes-man 
A broke man, approachin the bench with intent 
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man 
Evidence stemmin from QUANTITY 
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix 
While they was usin cut, I was on some other shit 
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it 
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised 
ORG to testimony about my foul ways 
Exhibit A Reasonable Doubt 
They say this was the ORDINAL thing that turned the peoples out 
You can feel the tension building here 
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out 
For what may be the trial of the century 
They call me dope man, dope man 
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
Ghetto spokes-man 
How come, you label your brand of dope 
Vol. one and spread it through the slums? 
ORG it to the young with total disregard 
Your honor, the ORG seeks the maximum charge 
And how could you, turn right around 
And release a lethal dosage called Vol. CARDINAL 
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise 
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise? 
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise 
Of record execs, and do you object? 
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects 
Def Jam, you pushed over five million ORG 
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen 
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, PERSON and Russell Simmons 
And we ain't gon talk about Murder Inc 
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link 
The ORG is seeking the maximum penalty 
And with the overwhelmin amount of evidence 
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin good 
They call me dope man, dope man 
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
Ghetto spokes-man 
Despite the grim outlook at this point 
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant 
In the face of adversity 
They call me dope man, dope man 
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
Ghetto spokes-man 
PERSON is taking the stand 
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air 
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear 
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance 
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands 
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up 
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up 
Where you drop your cracks off by the ORG trucks 
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors 
Keep GPE spiralin', goin backwards 
At age nine, saw my ORDINAL hate crime 
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line 
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine 
Climbed PERSON shined 
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze CARDINAL 
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine 
The soul of PERSON in this modern day time 
While the jury is inside deliberatin 
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation 
They call me dope man, dope man 
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man 
Ghetto spokes-man 
Well the verdict has just been announced NOT GUILTY! 
It is complete pandemonium out here! 
People are cheerin and PERSON - there he is 
PERSON is exitin the courtroom right now 
There is a swarm of cameras PERSON him {} 
And people are just rushin up to him 
Let's John John!

“I work and work til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying
She's getting old, and what do I get? A daughter
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
As she cares about ME!”
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely twelve noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest
Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.
I dream filthy My mom and pops
Mixed me with Jamaican Rum and whiskey, what a set off
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to re it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest
No... wire... hangers... EVER!
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest",nan,male,song,"

“I work and work til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying 
She's getting old, and what do I get? A daughter 
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her 
As she cares about ME!” 
Let's do this for these babies 
ORG truck, fuck, houses on acres 
Blatantly ballin on HD 
ORG need to step up y'all AV 
Life changed again I was already taking off 
My flight changed again 
Slight change of winds 
It's barely twelve noon and my wife changed again 
Baby need Pampers 
Daddy need at least three weeks in the LOC 
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block 
I thought my daddy didn't love me 
My baby getting chubby 
Cue that PERSON Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely? 
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly 
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby 
NORP joint custody, I need a joint right now 
Just the thought alone fucks with me 
High on life 
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor 
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter 
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest 
Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my ORDINAL time at the rodeo. 
I dream filthy My mom and pops 
Mixed me with NORP Rum and whiskey, what a set off 
And I know I'm not perfect baby 
I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to re it 
With some doctors and some nurses maybe 
Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the Cedes 
This relationship shit is complicated 
All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it 
I don't wanna duplicate it 
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin crazy 
And I got that nigga blood in me 
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me 
High on life 
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor 
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter 
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest 
No... wire... hangers... EVER! 
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother 
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another 
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama 
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer 
Out in GPE on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower 
And a PERSON wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us 
For the beauty that you be Blue be 
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears 
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy 
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy 
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him 
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him 
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her ORDINAL steps 
Cut the cord watch her take her ORDINAL breath 
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared 
But in life and death if I ain't here 
High on life 
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor 
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter 
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest"
Holler If Ya Hear Me,2Pac,"
Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks
And the punk police can't fade me and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last til the po gettin mo cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'mma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me see it clearly?
You're too near me
Holler if ya hear me!
Hard
Tellin you to hear it
The rebel
Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me, PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin til other brothers bubble
Holler if ya hear me!
Hard
Tellin you to hear it
The rebel
Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I kick
Representin', never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me til they kill me
I love it when they fear me
Holler if ya hear me!
Hard
Tellin you to hear it
The rebel
You're too near me, to see it clearly
Holler if ya hear me!
Hard
Tellin you to hear it

Aww yeah, uhh, uhh 
PERSON if ya hear me, yeah 
Here we go, turn it up, let's start 
From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks 
And the punk police can't fade me and maybe 
We can have peace someday, G 
But right now I got my mind set up 
PERSON down the barrel of my nine, get up 
Cause it's time to make the payback fat 
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black 
And accept no substitutes 
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school 
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek 
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week 
Now we got a nigga smash, blast 
How long will it last til the po gettin mo cash 
Until then, raise up! 
Tell my young black males, blaze up! 
Life's a mess don't stress, test 
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin', blessed 
Much love to my brothers in the pen 
See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in 
Once again it's an all out scrap 
Keep your hands on ya gat, now ya boys watch ya back 
Cause in the alleys out in NORP I'mma tell ya 
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya 
Scream, if ya feel me see it clearly? 
You're too near me 
Holler if ya hear me! 
Hard 
Tellin you to hear it 
The rebel 
Pump ya fists like this 
PERSON if ya hear me, PUMP PUMP if you're pissed 
To the sell-outs, livin it up 
CARDINAL way or another you'll be givin it up, huh 
I guess cause I'm black born 
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on 
But it's time for a new plan, BAM! 
I'll be swingin like a CARDINAL man, clan 
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop 
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops 
I'm still around for ya 
Keepin my sound underground for ya 
And I'ma throw a change up 
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up! 
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets 
They feel me when they rollin in they fat jeeps 
This ain't just a rap song, a black song 
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on 
And look for me in the struggle 
PERSON til other brothers bubble 
Holler if ya hear me! 
Hard 
Tellin you to hear it 
The rebel 
Will I quit, will I quit? 
They claim that I'm violent, but still I kick 
Representin', never give up on a good thing 
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing 
And now I'm like a major threat 
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget 
Bring the noise to all my boys 
Know the real from the NORP and the decoys 
And if ya hustle like a real G 
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, PERSON if ya hear me 
Learn to survive in the QUANTITY 
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay 
Whatever it takes to live and stand 
Cause nobody else'll give a damn 
So we live like caged beasts 
Waitin for the day to let the rage free 
Still me til they kill me 
I love it when they fear me 
Holler if ya hear me! 
Hard 
Tellin you to hear it 
The rebel 
You're too near me, to see it clearly 
Holler if ya hear me! 
Hard 
Tellin you to hear it 
The rebel"""
Representin’ 93,2Pac,"
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
Roll up and get swoll up, hold up
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?
I ain't came a long way to get checked
So give me respect when I get wreck
Or get your motherfuckin chin checked
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open
Say your looking for some real shit
Then catch a funkified batch, like that!!
Oakland's on the map
own_name is on the big screen strivin
Gotta love a nigga for survivin
I wear alot of old schools jewels
Look how the fools drool, ooohh
Stop lookin at me hard cause you're buffer
But I'll just buck them bigger motherfuckers
Turnin men to suckers
Niggas wanna start a little ruckus
Better duck cause I'll be poppin them motherfuckers
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
Hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right
Then hit em wit the uppercut, duck quick
Shit outta luck, fucked and stuck with that rough shit
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio, fuck the radio
Do you hear me though?
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen
And my murderous partners wit their Mac tens
I represent the real cause I'm ill, G
Glock cocked the day they kill me
I'm representin
Peace to Redman, Treach, Vin Rock, Kay Gee the great one
Mary J. Blige, Pete Rock and Troy, the late son
Heavy D, CL Smooth, and Queen Latifah
Too Short, Tony Toni Tone, LayLaw beat cuts
Ed, the special motherfucker and the Lover
The Tribe, A Tribe Called Quest, and Jungle Brothers
Das EFX, EPMD, and Ice Cube
House of Pain funky blunted ass white dudes
Cypress Hill, yeah, the ill niggas
Digital Underground my real niggas
Raw Fusion, Organized Konfusion
Wicked and the Mouse Man, Spice one and Pooh Man
TLC, Eric B., Rakim, then Scarface
Stretch, Maj, K-Low, pumpin the Squad's bass
Thorough Heads, Poonannynans, The Click
E-forty, The Governor, and Richie Rich
Young Guns in the house pumpin the flava
DJ Ditch for their behavior
Off the head, my freestyle flow
Just a couple of motherfuckers that I know
I'm strictly representin
one motherfucker, two motherfucker, three motherfuckers
Damn, who did I forget?
I'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja
Strong in the struggle
Must contend so it's on
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
Mad motherfuckers
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's
Ah shit! Pulled up in a benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it
To get specific If the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit
Now they wanna ban me Told ya
All I wanted to be was a soulja
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
Huh, I'm representin'",nan,male,song,"

I got a head, but ain't no screws in it 
Roll up and get swoll up, hold up 
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut? 
I ain't came a long way to get checked 
So give me respect when I get wreck 
Or get your motherfuckin chin checked 
Once again, it's your friend outta GPE 
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open 
Say your looking for some real shit 
Then catch a funkified batch, like that!! 
Oakland's on the map 
PERSON is on the big screen strivin 
Gotta love a nigga for survivin 
I wear alot of old schools jewels 
Look how the fools drool, ooohh 
Stop lookin at me hard cause you're buffer 
But I'll just buck them bigger motherfuckers 
Turnin men to suckers 
Niggas wanna start a little ruckus 
Better duck cause I'll be poppin them motherfuckers 
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight 
Hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right 
Then hit em wit the uppercut, duck quick 
Shit outta luck, PERSON and stuck with that rough shit 
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio, fuck the radio 
Do you hear me though? 
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen 
And my murderous partners wit their ORG tens 
I represent the real cause I'm ill, G 
Glock cocked the day they kill me 
I'm representin 
Peace to Redman, Treach, Vin Rock, Kay Gee the great one 
Mary J. Blige, Pete Rock and Troy, the late son

CARDINAL motherfucker, CARDINAL motherfucker, CARDINAL motherfuckers 
Damn, who did I forget?

Strong in the struggle

Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers 
Mad motherfuckers 
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers 
Now they know me, the homies 
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's 
Ah shit! Pulled up in a benzy, snatch 
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail 
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit 
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it 
To get specific If the shoe fits, then kick it 
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it 
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit 
Now they wanna ban me Told ya 
All I wanted to be was a soulja 
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up 
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up 
Huh, I'm representin'"
Ghost,2Pac,"
The only way, for me to come back, is by own_name
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine
You motherfuckers can't stop me laughing
Even if I die, I'm gon be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
Five-zero I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs
GIVE IT UP NIGGA Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-ten out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
Hey man, come the fuck on
And then we'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!",nan,male,song,"

The only way, for me to come back, is by PERSON 
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me 
I'm taking back what's mine 
You motherfuckers can't stop me laughing 
Even if I die, I'm gon be a fuckin problem 
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker? 
Real live black... ghosts 
Feel me? 
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me 
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies 
PERSON was a motherfuckin, joke 
Used to find dope in his coat 
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke 
Daaamn, don't get me started 
My mama smoked so goddamn much 
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded 
At TIME I can't sleep, count sheep 
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors CARDINAL deep 
Starin at the wall, heard a scream 
Wake up in the mornin 
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene 
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die 
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby 
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack 
And the ORG jack those that don't watch they back 
CARDINAL I daydream about the dope world 
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl 
My PERSON goes BOOM, what's another plug 
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs 
GIVE IT UP NIGGA Don't run out of breath 
Every step could be death til you blast 
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost 
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die 
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby 
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die 
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby 
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by 
Thought I was trippin the ORDINAL time they rolled, by 
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar 
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya 
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep 
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep 
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce 
A Mac-ten out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do 
Run for cover and return fire 
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why 
But I let off everything I have 
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash 
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now 
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down 
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by 
Still runnin like a nigga got CARDINAL lives 
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block 
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops 
ORG to be a ghost 
Hey man, come the fuck on 
And then we'll be ghost 
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die 
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby 
FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!"
Don’t You Trust Me,2Pac,"I ain't got time for this, man I'm out
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by don't you trust me
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
not that I don't trust you
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin crazy this is slavery
You own_name better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get third degree
Where you been and who you wit', I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
You're suspicious I deceive, gimme grief without belief
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me, and support that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by don't you trust me
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
not that I don't trust you
Callin at my house then hangin up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're sayin I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead, you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me?
Instead, I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin
Fightin back the urge to just start cryin
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by don't you trust me
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
not that I don't trust you
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
Comin over cryin just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't own_name outtie
This time I'm breakin out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya!
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin
Not because we rushed it
Don't you trust me?
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by don't you trust me
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you",nan,male,song,"U LLXL LL LL LL LLX LL UXL LL

You should stop, for a while 
You will find me standing by don't you trust me 
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you 
You spend all your hours just rushing, around 
Do you have a little time 
To have a little time for me? 
not that I don't trust you 
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me 
See you got me trapped I'm goin crazy this is slavery 
You PERSON better 
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters 
Soon as I come home it's like I get ORDINAL degree 
Where you been and who you wit', I get no room to breathe 
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve 
You're suspicious I deceive, gimme grief without belief 
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful 
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial 
Let me live my life and you can live yours 
Just be there to help me, and support that's what you're here for 
Not to give me stress and add to pressure 
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test 
I'm sorry if I left you all alone 
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone 
Don't you trust me? 
You should stop, for a while 
You will find me standing by don't you trust me 
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you 
You spend all your hours just rushing, around 
Do you have a little time 
To have a little time for me? 
not that I don't trust you 
PERSON at my house then hangin up, you think that makes sense? 
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends 
It's time for us to take our separate paths 
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past 
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous 
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this 
You're sayin I'm too busy, I ignore you 
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you 
But now it seems the arguments are nightly 
I wanna hold you tightly but instead, you wanna fight me 
So why let it stress and aggravate me? 
Instead, I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me 
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin 
Fightin back the urge to just start cryin 
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me 
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me? 
You should stop, for a while 
You will find me standing by don't you trust me 
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you 
You spend all your hours just rushing, around 
Do you have a little time 
To have a little time for me? 
not that I don't trust you 
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin at me 
Maybe we should end it, neither CARDINAL of us are happy 
You know that I'm emotional, you know me 
Comin over cryin just to get me feelin guilty 
You and me were meant to be and yet 
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get 
Don't John outtie 
This time I'm breakin out, you let your mouth overcrowd me 
I can't take the beefin and the griefin 
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin 
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure 
And I can give you more when you mature 
But baby until then I gotta leave ya 
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya! 
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin 
Not because we rushed it 
Don't you trust me? 
You should stop, for a while 
You will find me standing by don't you trust me 
Over here, at the side, of your life it's not that I don't trust you 
You spend all your hours just rushing, around 
Do you have a little time 
To have a little time for me? 
not that I don't trust you 
Don't you trust me? 
It's not that I don't trust you 
Don't you trust me? 
It's not that I don't trust you"
Thug 4 Life,2Pac,"
Hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?
Mobbin like a motherfucker, stuck
Can you picture a middle finger out the window, gettin fucked
Off liquor get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black
So be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me, what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin dirt
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in, buckin my motherfuckin Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried, ‘cause I'll be buckin in a fuckin hurry
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Shootin crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin money
But you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes
These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
A young nigga tryin to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hatin hoes
Freakin down on niggas, jumpin around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin in L.A., still clutchin on my AK
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Shootin crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em
Thug for life, beyatch!
Yeah, nigga, Thug Life
From now until for motherfuckin forever
Have-nots in this, motherfucker",nan,male,song,"

Hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga 
Can't you read the signs? 
PERSON like a motherfucker, stuck 
Can you picture a middle finger out the window, gettin fucked 
Off liquor get loaded, can't control it 
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it 
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black 
So be a mack and keep your dough fat 
And tell me, what does it take to be a G? 
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki 
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert 
Started as a young motherfucker doin dirt 
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies 
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies 
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun 
Stuck in, buckin my motherfuckin Magnum 
What does it take to be a G? 
Silence is a must, violence is a plus 
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry 
Pick a spot to be buried, ‘cause I'll be buckin in a fuckin hurry 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Shootin crooked ass cops, let me fry 
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary 
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Game thicker than most of these tricks 
I got my mind on makin money 
But you stuck on these fake bitches 
And jealous motherfuckers can't see 
That's it's the fame that causes 
These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free 
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me? 
A young nigga tryin to hustle up some G's 
You pussy-ass playa hatin hoes 
Freakin down on niggas, jumpin around at the shows 
And you the ORDINAL motherfucker to jump 
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk 
Thug motherfuckers don't die 
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker 
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay 
I'm livin in L.A., still clutchin on my AK 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Shootin crooked ass cops, let me fry 
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary 
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Thug for life, high til I die 
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell em 
Thug for life, beyatch! 
Yeah, nigga, Thug Life 
From now until for motherfuckin forever 
Have-nots in this, motherfucker"

Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy
Want-want-want some more, want some more

Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, “Thank you”
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches “BJ”
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch My name
My name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga 
Want some more, want some more 
Even though a nigga been getting to it 
Want-want-want some more 
Still, want some more Want some more, want some more 
Everytime I end up getting it 
Want-want-want-want some more 
When they start talking crazy 
That's when I know that they want some more 
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it 
Cause I want some more 
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy 
That's when I know that they want some more 
Every time I end up getting it 
Want-want-want-want some more 
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money 
One minute they hate me, then they love me 
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny 
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny 
Who-who-who had PERSON on the ORDINAL album? 
Who had PERSON saying, “She a problem?” 
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column? 
Who-who made Lil Wayne give em five million? 
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet? 
Football touchdown on the ORG jet 
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet 
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet 
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest 
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh 
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me? 
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes 
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy 
Want-want-want some more, want some more 
Even though a nigga been getting to it 
Want-want-want some more 
Still, want some more Want some more, want some more 
Every time I end up getting it 
Want-want-want-want some more

Cause I want some more 
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy 
That's when I know that they want some more 
Every time I end up getting it 
Want-want-want-want some more 
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty 
I popped a ORG and I said, “Thank you” 
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day 
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches “BJ” 
They want that union, they want that PERSON 
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway 
My name Barbie, bitch My name 
My name Barbie, bitch 
PERSON made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King 
I'm late to my own party, bitch 
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing 
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something 
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket 
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it? 
Cash Money, getting CARDINAL albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album 
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem 
Want-want-want some more, want some more 
Even though a nigga been getting to it 
Want-want-want some more 
Still, want some more Want some more, want some more 
Every time I end up getting it 
Want-want-want-want some more 
When they start talking crazy 
That's when I know that they want some more 
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it 
Cause I want some more 
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy

Hey, you, jump in this ride 
It's real nice, it's slippery inside 
Wise guy, come get this pie 
R-r-ride it, ride it in style 
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago 
I drop it, I pick it up slow 
I want it, I'm kicking it though 
Cause they know that I got that good shit 
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch 
Squeeze my body, rock my body 
Boy, you make me go 
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

Yeah, I want you every day 
You're so right So right 
You're so tight So tight 
You got my world spinnin 
You got my world spinnin 
My head goes round and around, r-round and around 
And I'm thinking if we could be

I'm lookin for some brain to boost my IQ 
I'm like CARDINAL 
My SAT scores was high too 
But I don't wanna brag, I Louis Vuitton bagged him 
Hopped out the jag, proceeded to shag-shagged him 
Slim, trim, also light skin 
So ORG put the pipe in 
Squeeze my body, rock my body 
Boy, you make me go 
“Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,” me go

Lola from the Copa,MC Lyte,"Lola hopped into a cab, she went to work
As she walked into the club, the fellas went bezerk
They screamed her name out -- Lola, Lola
Yeah, she was the star of the Copa
She smiled and danced til morning
Lola took uppers, to stop her from yawning
For the finale, she got an applause
Lola was gracious, she didn't do tours
She felt appreciated, just like a star
But for the meanwhile, she got a drink from the bar
Lola had no kids and lost her mother
Her lover used drugs and left her for another
But little did she know that she would make love tonight
She'd do it willingly without puttin up a fight
	Lola.. she was a showgirl..
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..
At the bar, his name was Zeke the Freak
He just moved in down the street
He introduced himself and bought her a drink
Before she could refuse, she didn't stop to think
More and more alcohol, now she was intoxicated
He picked her up off her feet, as he escapaded
Down the block then he opened the door
As he struggled to get in, then put her on the floor
He went to the door to make sure that it was locked
As he bolted all of them, he looked up at the clock
It said one, or maybe he'd be done in two
Or two and three, eventually, how freaky could he be?
He began to think what should I do firstly?
I'll get a little drink, because I'm very thirsty
He got a little OJ, to make it really OK
Grabbed a wad of Hubba Bubba, but didn't use a rubber
They did it for three hours, he jumped into the shower
Got out and towel dried, and screamed, I've got the power!
He came out of the bathroom, she was still on the floor
He said, Heck I've got to wreck, then he jumped on for more
	Lola.. uh-huh she was a showgirl..
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..
	She met this guy named Zeke..
	who was truly a freak..
	And she didn't stop to think..
	before she took that sunrise drink..
She finally awoke, eight o'clock in the morning
Not remembering a stroke, as she began yawning
Zeke the Freak thought he was thick and slick
But what Zeke did not know
Is that little Lola, little Lola
From the Copa used to be a hoe
Now he's paid, thought he had it made
But Zeke the Freak got AIDS
	Lola.. she was a showgirl.. yeah
	with yellow ribbons in her hair..
	and a dress right up to here..
	She met this guy named Zeke..
	who was truly a freak..
	And she didn't stop to think..
	before she took that sunrise drink..
	He caught a bad one..
	while he was havin fun..
	Took Lola to his bed
	And now the freak is -- dead",nan,female,song,"ULL LL LL L LLX LL LL LL LL

work 
As she walked into the club, the fellas went bezerk 
They screamed her name out -- Lola, PERSONPERSON 
Yeah, she was the star of the LOC 
She smiled and danced til morning 
PERSON took uppers, to stop her from yawning 
For the finale, she got an applause 
PERSON was gracious, she didn't do tours 
She felt appreciated, just like a star 
But for the meanwhile, she got a drink from the bar 
PERSON had no kids and lost her mother 
Her lover used drugs and left her for another 
But little did she know that she would make love tonight 
She'd do it willingly without puttin up a fight 
Lola.. she was a showgirl.. 
with yellow ribbons in her hair.. 
and a dress right up to here.. 
At the bar, his name was PERSON the Freak 
He just moved in down the street 
He introduced himself and bought her a drink 
Before she could refuse, she didn't stop to think 
More and more alcohol, now she was intoxicated 
He picked her up off her feet, as he escapaded 
Down the block then he opened the door 
As he struggled to get in, then put her on the floor 
He went to the door to make sure that it was locked 
As he bolted all of them, he looked up at the clock 
It said one, or maybe he'd be done in CARDINAL 
Or two and three, eventually, how freaky could he be? 
He began to think what should I do firstly? 
I'll get a little drink, because I'm very thirsty 
He got a little OJ, to make it really OK 
Grabbed a wad of Hubba Bubba, but didn't use a rubber 
They did it for three hours, he jumped into the shower 
Got out and towel dried, and screamed, I've got the power! 
He came out of the bathroom, she was still on the floor 
He said, Heck I've got to wreck, then he jumped on for more 
Lola.. uh-huh she was a showgirl.. 
with yellow ribbons in her hair.. 
and a dress right up to here.. 
She met this guy named Zeke.. 
who was truly a freak.. 
And she didn't stop to think.. 
before she took that sunrise drink.. 
She finally awoke, eight o'clock in the morning 
Not remembering a stroke, as she began yawning 
Zeke the Freak thought he was thick and slick 
But what PERSON did not know 
Is that little Lola, little PERSONPERSON 
From the LOC used to be a hoe 
Now he's paid, thought he had it made 
But PERSON the Freak got AIDS 
Lola.. she was a showgirl.. yeah 
with yellow ribbons in her hair.. 
and a dress right up to here.. 
She met this guy named Zeke.. 
who was truly a freak.. 
And she didn't stop to think..

No Work,Queen Latifah,"
You ain't got no work for me no work
Or any Flavor Unit MC no work
You ain't got no work for me no work
You own_name work
Don't try to get fly, y'all
We're blackin up eye balls
I run with a rough set
So don't get me upset
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass
So why you startin
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin on my bra, you freakin strap hanger
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you, nineteen ninety-three
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family
Cause I would die for all them
And they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female
All catch hell
An explanation of the own_name
Spelled well
So blow up and know me
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin me
Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home
That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin joint with the hard core phrase
 I wouldn't diss another sister less she had it coming
And even then, I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning
Cunning as a venus fly trap
Cause, word up, I fight back
And damn right, it's like that
So step back
I'm not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
I'm not the type of girl
To be running to the cops
I know about everything
That goes on on my block
And right beside my bed
I keep a Luger and a Glock
They're for the protection of
A Flavor Unit own_name
Me not gon let ya go
Until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes
When I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you
Now, this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives
You're kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path
Across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstyle
And the conductor threw me out
You feelin kinda horny?
Call a clinic on that grout
You's a dingy, dirty bitch
So I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here, plus there
Cause I'll be here plus there
 everywhere
Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody, but they're bad instead
We're ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought, I thought twice
Thought through, and thought first
The own_name shirt
You hurt when I smirk
Cause you know first
You own_name work
You ain't got no work for me no work
You own_name work
I said you ain't got no work for me no work
You own_name work
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs no work
I said you ain't got no work for me no work
I said you ain't got no work for me no work)",nan,female,song,"

You ain't got no work for me no work 
Or any Flavor Unit PERSON no work 
You ain't got no work for me no work 
You PERSON work 
Don't try to get fly, y'all 
We're blackin up eye balls 
I run with a rough set 
So don't get me upset 
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin 
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass 
So why you startin 
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write 
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic 
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger 
Stop ridin on my bra, you freakin strap hanger 
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free 
I made a resolution for you, nineteen ninety-three 
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family 
Cause I would die for all them 
And they would die for me 
PERSON about this intelligent female 
All catch hell 
An explanation of the PERSON 
Spelled well 
So blow up and know me 
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin me 
Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown 
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home 
That was the way it started out back in the day 
A little singin joint with the hard core phrase 
I wouldn't diss another sister less she had it coming 
And even then, I would take it to her face 
My presence is stunning 
Cunning as a PRODUCT fly trap 
Cause, word up, I fight back 
And damn right, it's like that 
So step back 
I'm not the type of girl 
You can run through and drop 
I'm not the type of girl 
To be running to the cops 
I know about everything 
That goes on on my block 
And right beside my bed 
I keep a PRODUCT and a Glock 
They're for the protection of 
A ORG Unit PERSON 
Me not gon let ya go 
Until me hear ya scream 
I look in your eyes 
When I speak to your punk ass 
I ought to put my feet to you 
Now, this wicked curse hurts 
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed 
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed 
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe 
I scribe with CARDINAL lives 
You're kicked inside outside 
I used to ride the path 
Across the tracks in your mouth 
Until I jumped the turnstyle 
And the conductor threw me out 
You feelin kinda horny? 
Call a clinic on that grout 
You's a dingy, dirty bitch 
So I gotta Shout it out 
I had it up to here, plus there 
Cause I'll be here plus there 
everywhere 
Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed 
I get my niggies with the hoodies 
Far from goody, but they're bad instead 
We're ready for the worst things first 
Anything you thought, I thought twice 
Thought through, and thought first 
The PERSON shirt 
You hurt when I smirk 
Cause you know first 
You PERSON work 
You ain't got no work for me no work 
You PERSON work 
I said you ain't got no work for me no work 
You PERSON work 
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs no work 
I said you ain't got no work for me no work 
I said you ain't got no work for me no work)"

One On One,MC Lyte,"Yeah, yeah, ooh
Smooth better that I ever seen him look
As I flip the vibe book
He's on the front page, never looking his age
He's all that and I'm all in so let the games begin
Now I'ma give you something so you could get into it
I got the side view so I could watch ya do it
You've been on my mind but you're so hard to find
Holly woods got a hold on that behind
I ain't ashamed to play the game
Listen here, I won't say no names
Put your ass out, make your woman put your ass out
If you knew I was talking to you, you would pass out
Cause I gave you no type of indication
And if I did I was probably on some medication
I got the hots for your daddy and I just begun
Let's do this one on one
One, one, one, one

One, one, one, one
One, one, one, one
Just you and me, baby, one on one
Half way across the world I seen you at my show
With your girl back in Italy, but are you still into me?
Cause if you are I'm here to let you know
You don't have to be a superstar for me and you to go find
Now I ain't never lied you got the body of an angel
Bangle, bangle, watch the bojangle from every angle
I'm clocking you, honey
We could sign a prenup, I got my own money
I just wanna get to know you a little better
In own_name whatever
I wanna feel your muscle flex off your backbone
I got the Jones and I can't leave you alone
I wanna rub your deltoid down to your bicep
Better late than never and I'm sorry I slept
But now I'm well awake and I'm ready for the fun
Let's do this one on one

One, one, one, one
I wanna play that game

Just you and me, baby, one on one
Damn, the only brother make me look twice
Believe that baby, I wanna sacrifice
I'm on it, you couldn't shake me off if you tried
No sleeping on the job and I'm wide eyed
I like the video you got out, the song is butter
Try to keep a clean head and my mind out the gutter
But it's hard, you bring out the best and the worst
If I knew you way back when I would have let you hit it first
Love, it's like water on the brain
Only you can tame this run away train
Last time I seen ya, gleam in your eye
You was looking fly with your girl by your side
Shit, I ain't trying to take her place
I just wanna have your face all up in my space
I got the hots for ya and I just begun

I seen Sean the other day, he said
Damn I ain't know you had that
Ass, ass, ass, ass!"", leave no questions
I'm Jolie, when I'm on that D, I have you gone in sixty seconds
These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah
Polo should have been my logo, with a jockey around on my coat though
So I got to take em back to the drawing board
Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo
I turn up with my top missing, and hop out in a New Edition
I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen, my campfire, these smoke signals
Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me
The best is immaculate, attach it slowly
Broads got at where you act, they acting Tony
Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh
She don't know, she don't know a thing
She don't know a thing about me
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll
I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance
Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea
We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free
Watcha lookin at? Whatcha lookin at?
Watcha lookin at? Watcha lookin at?
I'm cooling in Italy
And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene
If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee
Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti
Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke
I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope
If you don't like it, I give you something to hold
Here's a D from you to me, you can call it my own
Damn own_name illy
Sewed up, really when the pen in the needle, you gon feel me
I got my fam with me, going ham, and that's some damn chilling
Take the night off, and with me we gon ride off, and we gon ride off
Watcha lookin at? Ugh!",nan,female,song,"

I seen PERSON the other day, he said 
Damn I ain't know you had that 
Ass, ass, ass, ass!"", leave no questions 
I'm Jolie, when I'm on that D, I have you gone in sixty seconds 
These bitches don't like me, ah, these haters want to fight me, ah 
Wake up and get caked up, put these bitches on diets, ah 
Polo should have been my logo, with a jockey around on my coat though 
So I got to take em back to the drawing board 
Cause it's time to make some hits for the mo'mo 
I turn up with my top missing, and hop out in a New Edition 
I'm propane, this Hell's Kitchen, my campfire, these smoke signals 
Sold some other shit, get these maggots off me 
The best is immaculate, attach it slowly 
ORG got at where you act, they acting PERSON 
Fuck you up in the ass, get the alimony, ugh 
She don't know, she don't know a thing 
She don't know a thing about me 
Well, she don't know that I'm on a roll 
I'm a motherfucking G, and we long distance 
Sipping on biscuits, sipping our tea 
We flip them the bird, then let them fly on for free 
Watcha PERSON at? Whatcha PERSON at? 
Watcha lookin at? Watcha lookin at? 
I'm cooling in GPE 
And a man could probably a tee, I'm making a scene 
If they rolling the camera's, my candids come with a fee 
Excuse my french, I speak deadly, bread throwing that cheddy 
My pocket's nauseous, these ones is vomit, I'm throwing up this confetti 
Ugh, I'm spazzing out, and yea I'm going for broke 
I'm gonna ride this wave kind of like a tube on the rope 
If you don't like it, I give you something to hold 
Here's a D from you to me, you can call it my own 
Damn John illy 
Sewed up, really when the pen in the needle, you gon feel me 
I got my fam with me, going ham, and that's some damn chilling 
Take the night off, and with me we gon ride off, and we gon ride off 
Watcha lookin at? Ugh!"

	""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far..
I'm too old?  What's with that crap?
Come on now brother, age is just a number
Anyway what matters is your state of mind
And if you give me some time I'll make your heart all mine
I don't like pushin and I don't like rushin
But most of all I don't like fussin
So come on now sweetie why don't ya stop frontin
Besides older folks come equipped for good lovin
Are you really serious?  Age really matters?
I thought telling you this, you would be flattered
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still ain't widdit
.. oh well, forget it, nope nope
But don't you dare touch me, you said you wasn't widdit
You own_name it
I coulda showed you things, taught you how to explore
My question is, what are you too young for?
I coulda shown you things that you never seen before
Took you all around on my wild world tour
But you're too young, too young to have fun
.. oh well, I'm done
	""I'm the dopest female..
	""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far..
..
	""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far..
It may sound nasty and it may sound mean
But I'm into little boys that are about seventeen
I don't know why, but they put up a fight
And hot damn that excites the own_name
Cause yo I love a young buck, that give a firm {fuck}
But once in a while, they become lovestruck
But that's okay though, cause I can handle them
I love young boys on the brink, of being young men
I mold em, shape em, make em then I break em in
They get the job done, I make em get the job done
Well, swell, make em kiss and tell
All of their friends around the neighborhood
That own_name GOOD
So tell me honey, are you ready to score?
Again I'll ask, what are you too young for?
	""I'm the dopest female..
	""I'm the dopest female..

	""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far..
	""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far..
Last but not least yo here's a description
Hard workin, not one that sells prescription
So if you're in school, that's okay
Get straight A's and I'll be back on Friday
You won't miss me, you know where to find me
And these words I will say finally
Never let age, restrict you from whatcha wanna do
Whether you're young or ninety-two
So if you're seventeen or around that age..
.. baby come to the stage
And if I didn't change your mind I'd find that odd
So when I ask this, think hard..
Call me the Master..
Call me the Master..

So when I ask this, think hard..

""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far.. 
I'm too old? What's with that crap? 
Come on now brother, age is just a number 
Anyway what matters is your state of mind 
And if you give me some time I'll make your heart all mine 
I don't like pushin and I don't like rushin 
But most of all I don't like fussin 
So come on now sweetie why don't ya stop frontin 
Besides older folks come equipped for good lovin 
Are you really serious? Age really matters? 
I thought telling you this, you would be flattered 
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still ain't widdit 
.. oh well, forget it, nope nope 
But don't you dare touch me, you said you wasn't widdit 
You PERSON it 
I coulda showed you things, taught you how to explore 
My question is, what are you too young for? 
I coulda shown you things that you never seen before 
Took you all around on my wild world tour 
But you're too young, too young to have fun 
.. oh well, I'm done 
""I'm the dopest female.. 
""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far.. 
.. 
""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far.. 
It may sound nasty and it may sound mean 
But I'm into little boys that are about seventeen 
I don't know why, but they put up a fight 
And hot damn that excites the PERSON 
Cause yo I love a young buck, that give a firm {fuck} 
But once in a while, they become lovestruck 
But that's okay though, cause I can handle them 
I love young boys on the brink, of being young men 
I mold em, shape em, make em then I break em in 
They get the job done, I make em get the job done 
Well, swell, make em kiss and tell 
All of their friends around the neighborhood 
That PERSON GOOD 
So tell me honey, are you ready to score? 
Again I'll ask, what are you too young for? 
""I'm the dopest female.. 
""I'm the dopest female.. 
.. 
""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far.. 
""I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far.. 
Last but not least yo here's a description 
Hard workin, not one that sells prescription 
So if you're in school, that's okay 
Get straight A's and I'll be back on DATE 
You won't miss me, you know where to find me 
And these words I will say finally 
Never let age, restrict you from whatcha wanna do 
Whether you're young or CARDINAL 
So if you're CARDINAL or around that age.. 
.. baby come to the stage 
And if I didn't change your mind I'd find that odd 
So when I ask this, think hard.. 
Call me the Master.. 
Call me the Master.. 
""Swingin with Master T.."""

Okay. own_name checker
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to Cali
Used to push a pink Denali, now it's Chevy Impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys
Now I get my work it out like Biggity-Bally
I used to go hard, used to cock the brim
Used to take the dollar car, used to shop at Vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean Cover Girl when I say easy breezy.
Jiminy Cricket, let the master in
When it come to bad bitches, I'm the last of kin
I'm bringing S-E-X-Y B-A-C-K
If own_name D-I-C-K
I'm Young Nicholas, my style ridiculous
I heard your money funny, and mommy, I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict
I don't know man. I think these bitches is real scared right now, like. Damn. I got these bitches shaking in they boots, man. Dirty money. Ayo, Pre'. Bring the next  in, my nigga. Chea! Chea! Chea! One time
I used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind
They think I'm making fun of them, when I be like Na-Na-Na-Na!
That's the track, little mama. Look Na-Na-Na-Na!
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me
Do it all for GP, tell em to suck a pee-pee
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics,  little mama, I can dig it
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic
Abracadab tricks are for kids, silly rabbit

I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict 
I don't know man. I think these bitches is real scared right now, like. Damn. I got these bitches shaking in they boots, man. Dirty money. Ayo, Pre'. Bring the next in, my nigga. Chea! Chea! Chea! CARDINAL time 
I used to make a dollar stretch like a PERSON 
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti 
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body 
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby 
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time 
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind 
They think I'm making fun of them, when I be like Na-Na-Na-Na! 
That's the track, little mama. Look Na-Na-Na-Na! 
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V 
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me 
Do it all for GP, tell em to suck a pee-pee 
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in GPE 
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet 
If you write your lyrics, little mama, I can dig it 
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic 
ORG tricks are for kids, silly rabbit 
Yes John Uh-huh"
nan,Nicki Minaj,"
You know they say who, who is own_name?
You know I'm like a multiple personality bitch
Like, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a ninja, I'm a boss
I'm, I'm the Harajuku Barbie!
Who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body
Dem haffi have a permit and a licence fi me
Admit it
Mi say, me moan and groan
Admit it, say me moan and groan
Admit it, say me moan and groan
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it
I just heard that I was the baddest in the town
So I came down and had to pick up my crown
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans
Call Wyclef, I'm a need a couple Haitians
Now where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bod gal, all my Guyanese?
I just found out that I was doper than Amy
Winehouse, maybe
Fresh out the navy
Fresher then a daisy
Used to be on Baisley
Young money bunny bitch please say the baby
Please stop callin me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?
Give em my keys, tell em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?
Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
Beam me up scotty
My wa-ba wine
My wine is too dutty
One, two, buckle my shoe
No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the forty-five special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry
I like mi chicken and mi goat with curry(yeah
Now, where my West Indies?
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas?
My madda cunt Trinis
My Jamaican bad gal, all my Guyanese?

You know they say who, who is John? 
You know I'm like a multiple personality bitch 
Like, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a ninja, I'm a boss 
I'm, I'm the Harajuku Barbie! 
Who said dem waan hackle mi body 
NORP haffi have a permit and a licence fi me 
Now tell me who said dem waan hackle mi body 
NORP haffi have a permit and a licence fi me 
Admit it 
Mi say, me moan and groan 
Admit it, say me moan and groan 
Admit it, say me moan and groan 
Admit it, -mit it, -mit it, -mit it 
I just heard that I was the baddest in the town 
So I came down and had to pick up my crown 
Went to GPE and had to pick up my wand 
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound 
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub 
That's why when I come around they hurry and run 
And I know it ain't math but I carry the CARDINAL 
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns 
Yao Ming, ORG need a couple NORP 
Sayonara, bitches, on a PRODUCT blazin 
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off NORP bajans 
Call Wyclef, I'm a need a couple NORP 
Now where my West Indies? 
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas? 
My madda cunt Trinis 
My NORP bod gal, all my Guyanese? 
I just found out that I was doper than PERSON 
Winehouse, maybe 
Fresh out the navy 
ORG then a daisy 
Used to be on ORG 
Young money bunny bitch please say the baby 
Please stop PERSON me, I'm such a rock star 
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar? 
Give em my keys, tell em valet my car 
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far 
Now all I need is a real mandingo 
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single 
Bootleg the mixtape out in GPE 
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria 
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where NORP girls say aloha 
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me ORG 
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur? 
Ahh, beam me up, PERSON 
My wa-wa wine 
My wine is too dutty 
Beam me up scotty 
My wa-ba wine 
My wine is too dutty 
One, two, buckle my shoe 
No one on the corner has swagger like I do 
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo 
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo 
Excuse me, I'm sorry 
I got the CARDINAL special, don't worry 
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry 
I like GPE chicken and GPE goat with curry(yeah 
Now, where my West Indies? 
Where the fuck my curry chicken and my rice and peas? 
My madda cunt Trinis 
My NORP bad gal, all my Guyanese?"

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'mma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules
I am who I am, uh!
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
I am who I am, uh!
I swear to God man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul
Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part?
Cause if not, it's just best we both part
Cause how am I supposed finish what you start?
You got me thinkin twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me? 
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me 
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin me 
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me 
So I'mma just tell myself that it works for me 
Take a real long drive in the ORG 
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets 
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules 
I am who I am, uh! 
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am 
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am 
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am 
I am who I am, uh! 
I swear to God man, everything in life is old 
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold 
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul 
Cause the ORDINAL time around I'll be twice as bold 
So do you take me to be who I am? 
To have and to hold till death do us part? 
Cause if not, it's just best we both part 
Cause how am I supposed finish what you start? 
You got me thinkin twice to just breathe 
Then you say I won't survive if I leave 
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve 
I no longer need your attention, at ease 
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score? 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar 
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score? 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar 
Now it's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score? 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar 
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score? 
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman hear me roar 
Here I am 
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am"

And all that, but I be representin for the ladies and
We got somethin to say, we've been quiet too long
Lady-like, very patient
We ain't get mad when Prince had his ass out
We thought he was gonna turn around to the front
And have the front out too! But you know, that didn't happen
We always had to deal with-with the guys
You know, talkin about how they gon wear us out on records
And-and you know so I had to do records that was strictly--
Representin for my ladies and how to keep yo man
Keep his eyes from wandering, looking around
And, sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug
I'm not sayin go out and do it, but if you do
Strap it up, before you smack it up
Flip it, slow it down, oh no!

Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
S-s-s on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
S-s-s on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
Konvict just like Akon
Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on

Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim 
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym 
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim 
PERSON on swim so they hate on him 
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before 
In a different life or where I record 
I mean he was Adam, I think I was PERSON 
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree 
PRODUCT on my chest cause I'm ready to save him 
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him 
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him 
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby

Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam 
Hot damn, make me scream like DATE Jam 
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland 
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky 
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai 
Somehow I understood him when he spoke NORP 
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly 
PRODUCT on my chest let me get my cape on 
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon 
PERSON just like PERSON 
Cause you know the Snitches be putting the GPE on

How Do I Love Thee,Queen Latifah,"
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How much do I love you
Well, multiply your love by infinity
Picture a vision of beauty
As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a native tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me
Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude it's not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
You're so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you""re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Don't stop
Ecstacy
So sweet
I adore you
Come to me
That's right
Come to me
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me
Please don't go
Happiness is nothing without you
Stay
My sweet one
I adore you
Hold me
Come to me
Love me
Love me",nan,female,song,"

How do I love thee 
Let me count the ways 
How much do I love you 
Well, multiply your love by infinity 
Picture a vision of beauty 
As we dance by the light of the moon 
Your passion so often consumes me 
Like the lick of a native tongue tune 
Reality is ours to create 
Fantasy is ours to mold 
Dream my love dream 
With my body and my soul 
Question out my faith 
I'm pledged to be your lover 
And after I started loving you 
I knew I'd never love another 
I'm like a child within your arms 
Would you come inside and play with me 
Spend the day with me 
Have your way with me 
Remember this always

No lie is true

Be Careful,Cardi B,"
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
Bout likin pictures, not returnin texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin culo
And putas, chillin poolside, livin two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin and bruisin'?
You gon gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin in the mirror different
Thinkin I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon hurt me to hate you, but lovin you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin self
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin and bruisin'?
You gon gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me",nan,female,song,"

Gave you TL C, you wan na creep and shit 
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit 
Man, I thought you would've learned your les son 
Bout likin pic tures, not re turnin texts 
I guess it's fine, man, I get the mes sage 
You still stut ter af ter cer tain ques tions 
You keep in con tact with cer tain ex es 
Do you, though, trust me, nig ga, it's cool, though 
Said that you was work in', but you out here chasin cu lo 
And putas, chill in pool side, livin two lives 
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times 
But if I did de cide to slide, find a nig ga 
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed 
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch 
And kar ma for you is gon be who you end up with 
You make me sick, nig ga 
The on ly man, baby, I adore 
I gave you ev ery thing, what's mine is yours 
I want you to live your life of course 
But I hope you get what you dyin for 
Be care ful with me, do you know what you doin'? 
Whose feel ings that you're hurtin and bruis in'? 
You gon gain the whole world 
But is it worth the girl that you're los in'? 
Be care ful with me

Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head 
You want some ran dom bitch up in your bed? 
She don't even know your mid dle name, watch her cause she might steal your chain 
You don't want some one who loves you in stead? I guess not though 
It's bla tant dis re spec t, you noth in like the nig ga I met 
Talk to me crazy and you quick to for get 
You even got me trip pin', you got me lookin in the mir ror dif fer ent 
Thinkin I'm flawed be cause you in con sis tent 
Be tween a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt 
It's gon hurt me to hate you, but lovin you's worse 
It all stops so abrup t, we start ed switchin it up 
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck 
Free to mess with some one else, I wish these feel ings could melt 
Cause you don't care about a thing ex cept your moth a fuckin self 
You make me sick, nig ga

I gave you ev ery thing, what's mine is yours 
I want you to live your life of course

Yeah 
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh 
Yeah, look 
I wanna get married, like the Currys, PERSON and PERSON shit 
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit 
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit 
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit 
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson 
Bout likin pictures, not returnin texts 
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message 
You still stutter after certain questions 
You keep in contact with certain exes 
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though 
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin culo 
And putas, PERSON poolside, livin CARDINAL lives 
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times 
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga 
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed 
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch 
And karma for you is gon be who you end up with 
You make me sick, nigga 
The only man, baby, I adore 
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours 
I want you to live your life of course 
But I hope you get what you dyin for 
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'? 
Whose feelings that you're hurtin and bruisin'? 
You gon gain the whole world 
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'? 
Be careful with me 
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin 
Be careful with me 
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it 
Be careful with me 
Care for me, care for me 
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me 
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look 
I was here before all of this 
Guess you actin out now, you got an audience 
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates? 
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon be misfortunate, nigga 
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head 
You want some random bitch up in your bed? 
She don't even know your middle name, watch her cause she might steal your chain 
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though 
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin like the nigga I met 
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget 
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin in the mirror different 
Thinkin I'm flawed because you inconsistent 
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt 
It's gon hurt me to hate you, but lovin you's worse 
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin it up 
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck 
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt 
Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin self 
You make me sick, nigga 
The only man, baby, I adore 
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours 
I want you to live your life of course 
But I hope you get what you dyin for 
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'? 
Whose feelings that you're hurtin and bruisin'? 
You gon gain the whole world 
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'? 
Be careful with me 
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin 
Be careful with me 
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it 
Be careful with me"
I Can’t Understand,Queen Latifah,"
I can't understand, I can't understand
I can't understand, I can't understand
It's got me goin crazy, things are goin crazy
Forgive me father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasn't causin it
She must be stupid as a fiend
I should have told the child You don't step to the own_name!
Perplexed and I'm vexed cause everywhere I go
People be flexin expectin me to wanna flow
I don't play that, the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback so whatcha sayin'?
You don't wanna be a sista in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now I'm fed, so it's off with your head
Now
The moral of the  is your career is through
And don't be fuckin with nobody who ain't fuckin with you
If I was in yo shoes I'd let the BS start walkin
Next time there might not be no talkin
A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Ain't make no diff to me, so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it, I fell in love with his soul
Aye papi! Aye! Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girl's number? Hmmm. That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey
There was a chick on the side! Oh no it couldn't be!
There was a chick on the side! He's down with OPP?
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin my thang
Why the negative vibes? And why do people take bribes?
I don't understand it, yo I don't know
Why do bad people live? And why do good people die?
Somebody gotta tell me why  I don't know
Why do people smoke crack? And why do White fight Black?
What's that scenario?  I don't know
Why do hearts get broken? Why the chumps get choked?
They know I ain't no joke  I don't know
Now, with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond
I'm tryin to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me, you know I just can't understand
What's goin on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But own_name yet
Cause when it comes to masterin confusion I'm a VET

I don't un der stand it, yo I don't know 
Why do bad peo ple live? And why do good peo ple die? 
Some body got ta tell me why I don't know 
Why do peo ple smoke crack? And why do White fight Black? 
What's that sce nar i o? I don't know 
Why do hearts get bro ken? Why the chumps get choked? 
They know I ain't no joke I don't know 
Now, with the drums to the bass to the pi ano to the horn 
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond 
I'm tryin to be as log i cal as I pos si bly can 
But for the life of me, you know I just can't un der stand 
What's goin on some times 
So sit u a tions like this come out in my rhymes 
But own_ name yet 
Cause when it comes to mas terin con fu sion I'm a VET","

I can't understand, I can't understand 
It's got me goin crazy, things are goin crazy 
Forgive me father for I have sinned 
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again 
She wasn't causin it 
She must be stupid as a fiend 
I should have told the child You don't step to the John! 
Perplexed and I'm vexed cause everywhere I go 
People be flexin expectin me to wanna flow 
I don't play that, the only way that 
I would be playing is if I pay back 
And run the playback so whatcha sayin'? 
You don't wanna be a sista in the name of rap 
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack 
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead 
But now I'm fed, so it's off with your head 
Now 
The moral of the is your career is through 
And don't be fuckin with nobody who ain't fuckin with you 
If I was in yo shoes I'd let the ORG start walkin 
Next time there might not be no talkin 
A brotha pushed up on me at the movies CARDINAL weekend 
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin 
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican 
Ain't make no diff to me, so we continued to speak and 
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll 
Before I knew it, I fell in love with his soul 
Aye papi! Aye! Was the cry as he made love to me 
I was freaked by the way he used to do me 
And then one day when I was washin our clothes 
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose 
A girl's number? Hmmm. That struck me kinda funny 
I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey 
There was a chick on the side! Oh no it couldn't be! 
There was a chick on the side! He's down with OPP? 
I gave you the whole shabang 
Just to find another woman hittin my thang 
Why the negative vibes? And why do people take bribes? 
I don't understand it, yo I don't know 
Why do bad people live? And why do good people die? 
Somebody gotta tell me why I don't know 
Why do people smoke crack? And why do White fight Black? 
What's that scenario? I don't know 
Why do hearts get broken? Why the chumps get choked? 
They know I ain't no joke I don't know 
Now, with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn 
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond 
I'm tryin to be as logical as I possibly can 
But for the life of me, you know I just can't understand 
What's goin on sometimes 
So situations like this come out in my rhymes 
But PERSON yet 
Cause when it comes to masterin confusion I'm a VET"

Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit em with the, oh-now-that's-just-ridiculous!
We could've cleared up all these particulars
That could have been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin', up at the ski loft
Thinkin we was on, you tellin me we off
Your whole vibe changed, when you got that phone call
That's the effect, they call a snow ball
Next thing you know, I was runnin down the hall
Sayin Please come back, I have given my all!
I have given my all
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon fall
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me
You wanted oh so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped, in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waitin', cause I am in need, of more attention
Could've called back, just to say somethin
I'mma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination, I'm not doing well, exclamation!
You succeeded at your attempts to make me -
Need you desperately, to vindicate me
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all, catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon fall
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me
Okay!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
It's, it's whatever you say, ay, ay
It's whatever you say, ay, ay
I am at your disposal
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy
Could you catch me? Could you catch me?
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me",nan,female,song,"

Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular 
Hit em with the, oh-now-that's-just-ridiculous! 
We could've cleared up all these particulars 
That could have been the homicide, vehicular 
You wasn't in no state to speed off 
You was PERSON out, yeah, you was peed off 
We was just chillin', up at the ski loft 
Thinkin we was on, you tellin me we off 
Your whole vibe changed, when you got that phone call 
That's the effect, they call a snow ball 
Next thing you know, I was runnin down the hall 
Sayin Please come back, I have given my all! 
I have given my all 
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small 
I have given my all 
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon fall 
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you 
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy 
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you 
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy 
Could you catch me? Could you catch me? 
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me 
You wanted oh so bad to prove points 
But your game always makes me lose points 
And your game always makes me concur 
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her 
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped, in your dimension 
So I will be on the mountain waitin', cause I am in need, of more attention 
Could've called back, just to say somethin 
ORG fall back in the bass drum 
Please come to destination, I'm not doing well, exclamation! 
You succeeded at your attempts to make me - 
Need you desperately, to vindicate me 
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small 
I have given my all, catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon fall 
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you 
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy 
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you 
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy 
Could you catch me? Could you catch me? 
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me 
Okay! 
Oh, oh, oh, okay! 
Oh, oh, oh, okay! 
It's, it's whatever you say, ay, ay 
It's whatever you say, ay, ay 
I am at your disposal 
My mind is made up, I'm waitin for you 
I'm waitin on you, waitin boy 
My mind is set, I'm waitin on you 
I'm waitin for you, waitin boy 
Could you catch me? Could you catch me? 
Could you catch me? I am waitin on you to catch me"
Teary Eyed,Missy Elliott,"Two thousand five!!
There will be no room for y'all with no originality
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You're, the reason I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one, from the places I've come
The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung
Boy you, bring the worst out of me HOLLA!
And I cain't, allow these tears I've cried
The emptiness inside, that left me so petrified
Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired
Cause you, bring the worst out of me
And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone
And start life and do it now maybe once again YES!
I don't know when or where but somethin must have went wrong
And all I have to sayyyy, is now...
When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've, done, to me me
I, comprimised all my time
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine
Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind
Cause you, brought the worst out of me you brought the worst out of me
This is, how the story goes WOO!
The others want to know, when it's out of control
You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt
And I guess, that, be, me

There will be no room for y'all with no originality 
ORG 
You're, the reason I don't trust no one 
And I don't love no one, from the places I've come 
The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung 
Boy you, bring the worst out of me HOLLA! 
And I cain't, allow these tears I've cried 
The emptiness inside, that left me so petrified 
Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired 
Cause you, bring the worst out of me 
And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone 
And start life and do it now maybe once again YES! 
I don't know when or where but somethin must have went wrong 
And all I have to sayyyy, is now... 
When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed 
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry 
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you 
Stay true to you, live life with you 
But look what you've, done, to me me 
I, comprimised all my time 
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine 
Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind 
Cause you, brought the worst out of me you brought the worst out of me 
This is, how the story goes WOO! 
The others want to know, when it's out of control 
You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt 
And I guess, that, be, me

nan,Lil’ Kim,"
I get a feeling there's gonna be a riot...
Uh, it's looking like I'm headed back behind bars again
Cause own_name arguing
I'm jet chartering, fresh cardigan
Getting my Martha in while these broke hoes borrowing
I guess it's back to stashing guns in the bra again
Pulling bitches out they car again
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look
Pop shit on Twitter and apologize on Facebook
And now they wanna send me requests
Telling me that I'm simply the best
I won't stop till I see my enemies rest
They probably get locked up for identity theft
I ain't got time for bum bitches, the gun get it
I come with it, anything you tryna do, I done did it
I'll let you live for a while but I'm dying with the crown
The own_name it
What y'all want, huh?
What y'all want, huh? Huh, huh
Be careful what y'all wish for
Cause now she's pissed off
And y'all gon feel her reign
This what y'all want, huh?
This what y'all want, huh? Huh, huh
Y'all got just what y'all wished for
Cause now she's pissed off
And ya'll gon feel her reign
Since you resist on running your jibbs off
After I drop these flowers for B.I.G. off
I'mma come and blow your lid off, like Adolf
Rolling up the tints, then peel off
Better wear your crosses and roseries, read the Qur'an
Pray to Allah for you think about approaching me
Uh, all I rock with is gutter niggas
Cut all affiliations with sucka niggas
I got bitches that'll gun-butt a nigga like Tameka and Tammy, uh
I gave birth to your style, watch how you speak to ya mammy
Your team can't fuck with my family
And I ain't talking Internal Revenue
I'm talking IRS, the Goodfella crew
Uh, you was never hard, check my repertoire
Fuck cash, my name is a black card
What y'all want, huh?
What y'all want, huh? Huh, huh
Be careful what y'all wish for
Cause now she's pissed off
And y'all gon feel her reign
This what y'all want, huh?
This what y'all want, huh? Huh, huh
Y'all got just what y'all wished for

I get a feeling there's gonna be a riot... 
Uh, it's looking like I'm headed back behind bars again 
Cause PERSON arguing 
I'm jet chartering, fresh cardigan 
Getting my PERSON in while these broke hoes borrowing 
I guess it's back to stashing guns in the bra again 
Pulling bitches out they car again 
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look 
Pop shit on ORG and apologize on ORG 
And now they wanna send me requests 
Telling me that I'm simply the best 
I won't stop till I see my enemies rest 
They probably get locked up for identity theft 
I ain't got time for bum bitches, the gun get it 
I come with it, anything you tryna do, I done did it 
I'll let you live for a while but I'm dying with the crown 
The PERSON it 
What y'all want, huh? 
What y'all want, huh? Huh, huh 
Be careful what y'all wish for 
Cause now she's pissed off 
And y'all gon feel her reign 
This what y'all want, huh? 
This what y'all want, huh? Huh, huh 
ORG got just what y'all wished for 
Cause now she's pissed off 
And ya'll gon feel her reign 
Since you resist on running your jibbs off 
After I drop these flowers for ORG off 
ORG come and blow your lid off, like PERSON 
Rolling up the tints, then peel off 
Better wear your crosses and roseries, read the Qur'an 
Pray to Allah for you think about approaching me 
Uh, all I rock with is gutter niggas 
Cut all affiliations with sucka niggas 
I got bitches that'll gun-butt a nigga like PERSON and Tammy, uh 
I gave birth to your style, watch how you speak to ya mammy 
Your team can't fuck with my family 
And I ain't talking Internal Revenue 
I'm talking IRS, the ORG crew 
Uh, you was never hard, check my repertoire 
Fuck cash, my name is a black card 
What y'all want, huh? 
What y'all want, huh? Huh, huh 
Be careful what y'all wish for 
Cause now she's pissed off 
And y'all gon feel her reign 
This what y'all want, huh? 
This what y'all want, huh? Huh, huh 
ORG got just what y'all wished for 
Cause now she's pissed off 
And ya'll gon feel her reign)\

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines
I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you
So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you?
It’s all good now
Goodbye now
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever",nan,female,song,"

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
I lied, I lied, I lied 
To keep you from breaking my heart 
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied 
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied 
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you 
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you 
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me 
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see 
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof 
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose? 
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine 
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines 
I lied 
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you 
Who knows, who knows, so I lied 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied 
I thought eventually, you would let me go 
That was my insecurities, and my ego 
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw 
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo 
Man it was good while it lasted 
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic 
If it was a record, it would have been classic 
But fuck you though, orgasmic 
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling 
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in? 
My mama ain't raised no fool 
I am not your usual typical type 
Who would protect me if I never hide? 
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you 
So I lied, I lied, I lied 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
I lied, ooh baby, oooh 
Cause what if I let myself go with you? 
It’s all good now 
Goodbye now 
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever"

Well it's the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me 
I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit 
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip 
How many of them coulda did it with finesse? 
Now everybody like, She really is the best 
You play checkers, couldn't beat me PERSON chess 
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest 
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong

I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin ORG 
Give me the password to the fuckin wifi"
nan,Lil’ Kim,"I'm the L-I-L to the K-I-M
And not B-I-G, R.I.P. ba-by
I, rep BK and the, N.Y.C
Don't no bitch do it like I D-I-D
And, own_name TV
Like, MTV and, BET
So T-R-L and, one-oh-six
I'm in heavy R.O. when they play my shit
Momma push whips like BM Dubs
And your B.M. trip when she see me in the club
Your man, five-oh, I don't see him in the club
Cause he out in the CT with a dick in his butt
Y'all stay OT while I stay O.C
That's, out the country with the A-R-A-B's
With my girl M to the O to the E
She ride like a soldier, that's my co-D
I'm Bella to that death and, don't ask why
Cause the Mafia is P-U-S-S-Y
And I'm more nigga than them bitch-ass guys
Cause they took the stand, on the D.A.'s side
I'm the B-A-D-D-E-S-T
Chick in the game - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
I keep it G-A-N-G-S-T-A
What more can I say - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
BK's finest, straight out the S-T-U-Y
And the girl stay fly - yo what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
It's the Q-U-double-E-N B-double-E
Hoes wanna be me - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
I'm in the Lamb or the Ferrari when I'm M.I.A
Take the Spyder down the strip, when I'm in V-A
The game slow, gotta put a little work in D.C
I ball like I'm WNBA's M.V.P
On, ESPN or, NBC
I like it raw like my boy the late O.D.B
Stop pullin out them burners on them DVD's
You gotta body a motherfucker to, impress me
My boys keep the M-A-C in the SUV
And they air somethin out on the, A-V-E
I'm in the B-E-N-Z doin a buck-oh-three
Tearin the clutch down on the B-Q-E
Get at niggas quick if they try to move me
A.S.A.P. like, T.I.P
You get chopped and screwed, honeygirl don't play
Nigga we ridin dirty like U.G.K
Make a wish when you see me like a falling star
Give a lot of y'all careers, CPR
First lady at the top of, R-A-P
I'm on my T-O-E's gettin that D-O-E
B-I-G, M-O, M-M-A
No info, for the, D.E.A
Federal agents mad cause I'm flagrant
Tapped the cell, and the phone in my basement
The IRS tryin to take my pay
And plus I'm bein spied on by the C.I.A
I locks it, I'm toxic like DDT
My flow get'cha high like PCP
I'm number one downloaded on your MPthree
I bang on you niggas like an MPC
I make a nigga nut in his D&G's
Cause no one do it better than the one Q.B

Court Is in Session,Queen Latifah,"
All rise for me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session
Ain't nobody stops my flows as if you didn't know
All eyes on me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session
I've been doing it for sometime, i'm back to blow ya mind!
Rap  one
Court is in session i'm the judge jury and the prosecution, my word cos mine conjugus
Ain't no need for confusion i'm here to stay me in the rap game party together like fusion
I wanna talk to Illuminati wanna let you ladies whose first hits screen gets me bar
I was dedicated to the party touring oa spreading our culture to different nationality
From MC like calories what ya need to do is pay homage and make some sister challenge me
Like i said just me on wax i'll be of value and it'll happen when you least expected exactly
If it ain't rough, I can do without it and some of you all MCs in hiphop just making the game crowded
Let's play a little game of elimination or detonation, separate the rack like segregation
All rise for me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session
Ain't nobody stops my flows as if you didn't know
All eyes on me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session
I've been doing it for sometime, i'm back to blow ya mind!
Rap  two
You know whats up choice stay on my piece you ain't no rapper you just play one on TV or radio and CD
Acting like you wanna see me but really cheeky geek i ain't see me
Check out my whole unit row this new kid study my scripts like the dead sea scroll
My M.O i'm in the back of a stretch land-cruise limo paying customer shot dollar dicussing
You see i am trying to hear nothing so i'm back to recap like Elmino, winds blow, clouds thunder spins the earth off its axis
Me slash rapper, slash actress, slash if you trying to front we get your ass kicked, we used P.O.W torture tactics
Who trying to get at us, cos my friends i feel pleasure in your pain like i should never
I should bronx my pimp we should be hanging platinum, pix i'm stackin em
Classics from me is automatic, i keep em hitting in the attic
Ladies rock to this, fellas on the floor grab your crotch to this, watch my progression court is in session
Rap  three
Flog your interest, pay attention to every sentence, all rise for me, all eyes on me
Send a shout-out of respect to all my people living, check the check it's gonna be alright
I rule in favor of the unit with a flavour, we make moves this major, this style coming like a pager
And we don't need that feedback, keep that, i know your crew is off the hook, we off the meat-rat
See that i know you wanna be like us real, already we that you can't be that, believe that
Make you jump outta your gatters and boots, sweats and limo suits, we winning my records on the table spinning
All our pockets getting fat while you thinning, you can't fade us we've been hustling since beginning
Put you hands in the air even if you hate us, we master of profession, court is in session
 till fade",nan,female,song,"

All rise for me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session

All eyes on me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session 
I've been doing it for sometime, i'm back to blow ya mind! 
Rap one 
Court is in session i'm the judge jury and the prosecution, my word cos mine conjugus 
Ain't no need for confusion i'm here to stay me in the rap game party together like fusion 
I wanna talk to NORP wanna let you ladies whose ORDINAL hits screen gets me bar 
I was dedicated to the party touring oa spreading our culture to different nationality 
From PERSON like calories what ya need to do is pay homage and make some sister challenge me 
Like i said just me on wax i'll be of value and it'll happen when you least expected exactly 
If it ain't rough, I can do without it and some of you all MCs in LOC just making the game crowded 
Let's play a little game of elimination or detonation, separate the rack like segregation 
All rise for me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session 
Ain't nobody stops my flows as if you didn't know 
All eyes on me all rise for me all eyes on me, watch my progression court is in session 
I've been doing it for sometime, i'm back to blow ya mind! 
Rap CARDINAL 
You know whats up choice stay on my piece you ain't no rapper you just play one on TV or radio and CD 
Acting like you wanna see me but really cheeky geek i ain't see me 
Check out my whole unit row this new kid study my scripts like the dead sea scroll 
My M.O i'm in the back of a stretch land-cruise limo paying customer shot dollar dicussing 
You see i am trying to hear nothing so i'm back to recap like Elmino, winds blow, clouds thunder spins the LOC off its axis 
Me slash rapper, slash actress, slash if you trying to front we get your ass kicked, we used P.O.W torture tactics 
Who trying to get at us, cos my friends i feel pleasure in your pain like i should never 
I should GPE my pimp we should be hanging platinum, pix i'm stackin em 
Classics from me is automatic, i keep em hitting in the attic 
Ladies rock to this, fellas on the floor grab your crotch to this, watch my progression court is in session 
Rap CARDINAL 
Flog your interest, pay attention to every sentence, all rise for me, all eyes on me 
Send a shout-out of respect to all my people living, check the check it's gonna be alright 
I rule in favor of the unit with a flavour, we make moves this major, this style coming like a pager 
And we don't need that feedback, keep that, i know your crew is off the hook, we off the meat-rat 
See that i know you wanna be like GPE real, already we that you can't be that, believe that 
Make you jump outta your gatters and boots, sweats and limo suits, we winning my records on the table spinning 
All our pockets getting fat while you thinning, you can't fade us we've been hustling since beginning 
Put you hands in the air even if you hate us, we master of profession, court is in session 
till fade"

I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
You’ll always be mine yeah, baby
Frozen in time
Young forever young forever)",nan,female,song,"
