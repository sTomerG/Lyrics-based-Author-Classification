(Pray 4) My Downfall,50 Cent," fourx)
Pray and pray
And pray for my downfall
Menace, scene from the movie
Clap the two, weigh the oozie
Goodfella jewelry heist
Diamonds in my bitch doobie
I sit back, think about the cats
They hate man I laugh at them
Get outta line I blast at them
They stay scheming
Fuck around let off a clip
And leave the whip leaning
They dreaming
I took the cream and
Move to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, shit
Cause when I flip
I make the paper
Dangerous, G-Unit
Niggas can't bang with us
It's undeniable the kid is nice
The flow CPR
I'll bring Biggie back to life
Man, Dre say I'm loony
Em say I'm moody
At least I don't smoke oolies
And fuck without rubbers
A handful of niggas hate
But the hood love us
You can pray
For my downfall
Motherfuckers
 eightx
Even if I slip
I'll get back
Nigga act up
Hollowtips'll
Tear your back up
Gain thirty pounds
When you die, no lie
I was high when they hit me
Had a few gats with me, shit
Ain't get a chance to let off
They shot me up and sped off
Apologies in order
Tamia I adore her
But now they strict
Cause my flow make money
Flow like water
Turn it up a notch
Twist the dutch
Zone to this, soak it up
See me in the club son
I'll send niggas to poke you up
You know my style forty cal
With me when I move around
Squeeze, catch the shell
And run before your ass
Hit the ground
Pussy niggas shouldn't talk
Keep my name out your mouth
Summerjam, understand
I'm the man
When I leave the crowd leave
Shook closer, game over
Ride or get rolled over

That black glove, wood grip, outline em in chalk shit

Time to ride, homicide, I'm down with it
I'll wave that chopper, hit your whip and shake the ground with it
Fuck with N dot Bonepart, get your ass blown apart
Hip hop's Napoleon, you know war, you know me then
I'll hunt you like a great dane
Hit you, hit you like a freight train
Run off with your fake chains
I'll give you mothafuckas somethin to believe in
Knife work your lungs, I'll make it hard to breathe in
Little shit could be a big enough reason
You're dancin with the wolves, fool, better feed them
I feel for you, you ain't ready for the outcome
Nigga I'll get at you all week with the same gun

The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin I'm playin
Me I punch every nigga first I had a fight with
Maybe it's genetics, mama made me like this
Cocaine baby, problem child, half crazy
Children of the Corn, I've been warned so long
Big strap for robberies with my little three hundred and eighty
I'll make your little lady miscarry a baby
You leave the scene unseen when I get to trippin
Pistol whip your head hard enough to blur your vision
What up, comrade, salute, I pull rank, I got bank
Just fucked up work, askin if we'll use shanks
Every clique I'm in my clique, nigga, I run shit
I put in my own work, run, get who you gon get
This is how it feels when you squeeze a Smith & Wesson
When talk is not an option, it's a form of expression
You got to go to work on a nigga
The red shit comin through the shirt on a nigga
My gift to a gravedigger
I get that dirt, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
Fasho I make that forty Cali blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin I'm playin
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin head, you get to testin me
You call the cops and I get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin I'm playin'",nan,male,song,"

That black glove, wood grip, outline em in chalk shit 
I don't wanna talk, say a prayer for my enemies 
Droptop, CARDINAL shots, I'll make your ass a memory 
ORG to ride, homicide, I'm down with it 
I'll wave that chopper, hit your whip and shake the ground with it 
Fuck with N dot Bonepart, get your ass blown apart 
Hip hop's Napoleon, you know war, you know me then 
I'll hunt you like a great dane 
Hit you, hit you like a freight train 
Run off with your fake chains 
I'll give you mothafuckas somethin to believe in 
Knife work your lungs, I'll make it hard to breathe in 
Little shit could be a big enough reason 
You're dancin with the wolves, fool, better feed them 
I feel for you, you ain't ready for the outcome 
Nigga I'll get at you all week with the same gun

Big strap for robberies with my little three hundred and eighty

Every clique I'm in my clique, nigga, I run shit

The Hit,50 Cent,"
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
Fifty-own_name, let's see if homicide trace this
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block
That's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz
Let's get this clear, it ain't on til I say it's on, it's on
I'm eating, ya'll niggas fasting like it's Ramadan
Bowlish own_name bomb
I be at the edge of the bar sipping a Don
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war now that my money long
Why you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize
The way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in
While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters
Ya'll should hate the game not the players, come on

Everyday is bugged, niggas will come to a club
To try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G?
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunchtime I start hitting em hard with punchlines
You own_name spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes
I change places to prevent catching the cases

Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us
At  in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Looking like last year's players
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding
Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since eighty-one
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong 
You want war? I take you to war now that my mon ey long 
Why you broke cats is by the by lines and fan ta size 
The way I'm spit ting, put TV's in ev ery thing I sit in 
While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you play er haters 
Ya'll should hate the game not the play er s, come on 
I change places to pre vent catch ing the cas es 
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces 
This is a hit, let's see if homi cide trace this 
Fifty own_ name, let's see if homi cide trace this

Ev ery day is bugged, nig gas will come to a club 
To try to show you they a thug in stead of show ing some love 
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me 
When I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G? 
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the may or 
And in the crack game I'm a fran chise play er 
Nig gas be think ing I be out to lunch with mines 
Then in crunchtime I start hit ting em hard with punch lines 
You own_ name spit 
Bet ter check my bat ting av er age, I al ways make hits 
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro 
Plus I pack a can non up un der my Marc Buchanan 
They fake, they look like mon ey, but ain't worth half the cake 
Have me run ning from Jake in a GS with bad brakes 
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes 
I change places to pre vent catch ing the cas es

Yo, son re mem ber them fake play ers who try to play us 
At in Ve gas 
Had them tight linen blaz ers and beat up gators 
Look ing like last year's play ers 
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do 
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bot tle of Mo 
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he hold ing 
Yeah he's pack ing, I can see his rack 
The one in the mid dle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son 
Yeah, so I ex pect look like they ain't had a run since eighty one 
They ain't here on a hunt for food 
So they could catch you some cash and ex pen sive jew els 
I'm gonna crash em with this bot tle if he move 
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy 
It won't go easy, be lieve me

I change places to prevent catching the cases 
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces 
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this 
Fifty-John, let's see if homicide trace this 
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block 
That's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz 
Let's get this clear, it ain't on til I say it's on, it's on 
I'm eating, GPE niggas fasting like it's Ramadan 
Bowlish John bomb 
I be at the edge of the bar sipping a PERSON 
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on 
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong 
You want war? I take you to war now that my money long 
Why you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize 
The way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in 
While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters 
GPE should hate the game not the players, come on

Everyday is bugged, niggas will come to a club 
To try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love 
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me 
When I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G? 
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor 
And in the crack game I'm a franchise player 
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines 
Then in crunchtime I start hitting em hard with punchlines 
You PERSON spit 
Better check my batting average, I always make hits 
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro 
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan 
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth CARDINAL the cake 
Have me running from GPE in a GS with bad brakes 
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes

Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us 
At in GPE 
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators 
Looking like last year's players 
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do 
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped CARDINAL bottle of Mo 
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding 
Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack 
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son 
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since DATE 
They ain't here on a hunt for food 
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels 
I'm gonna crash em with this bottle if he move 
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy 
It won't go easy, believe me

The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang

Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch em
You cut em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed

Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips

In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-fifteen, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you

Fuck with my dough What-what y'all niggas know? 
Then the guns come out Then the guns come out 
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine 
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind 
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind 
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time 
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll 
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors 
twenty-two inch chrome, a nigga money long 
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown 
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own 
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terrordome 
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins 
ORG still in the range, I'm doing my thang 
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away 
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day 
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head 
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead

In the hood, hoopty, hat low, niggas don't know I'm around 
Hop out, hit em up, lay my murder game down 
You see me in ya projects, one hundred and eighty-seven's in progress 
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch em 
You cut em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting em 
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed 
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel 
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill 
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo 
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed em too 
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York 
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk 
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some ORG 
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips 
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks 
I don't love em lover boy, we can share a bitch

Then the guns come out Then the guns come out 
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya 
In case your dumbass wanna tussle 
AR-fifteen, cooling system makes the shell case muffled 
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead 
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head 
Contract killa, murder for the ORG 
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga 
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga 
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy 
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready 
No exception to the rule, death is promised 
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas 
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you 
CARDINAL phone call and niggas will exterminate you 
No future fucking with me, there's no tomorrow 
Niggas'll run up on you TIME and hit you with hollows

GUNSHOT)"
Gangsta’s Delight,50 Cent,"
This is hip hop, it go clip pop
It hit em if ya hit me, the clip pop, it popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get em oh goodie
Keep the hoodie when you're fucking with me, me, me
Now what you hear is not a test
I said it's not a test, nigga, it's not a test
Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest
I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best
Tuck the nine by my spine all the time
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
In the club wilding out over Henny and Patron
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown
Shawty in my ear like 'please take me home'
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn
She said 'if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
I would've brought my friend' uh huh huh huh huh
I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore
I'm down by law, this style ya never saw
I give em just a little then watch em fiend for more
Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine
I have the whole night club going insane
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
Uh huh huh huh huh
I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest
I'm strapped moving round with the heat
I said I do it the best, I'm not the one you should test
That's why my name ring bells in the street
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah

PERSON said we bang bang boogie, we get em oh goodie 
Keep the hoodie when you're fucking with me, me, me 
Now what you hear is not a test 
I said it's not a test, nigga, it's not a test 
Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest 
I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best 
Tuck the CARDINAL by my spine all the time 
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine 
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe 
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa 
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne 
In the club wilding out over PERSON and Patron 
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone 
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown 
Shawty in my ear like 'please take me home' 
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone 
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn 
She said 'if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that 
I would've brought my friend' uh huh huh huh huh 
I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw 
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore 
I'm down by law, this style ya never saw 
I give em just a little then watch em fiend for more 
Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more 
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy 
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip 
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick 
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine 
I have the whole night club going insane 
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change 
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain 
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang 
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang 
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit 
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the CARDINAL 
Uh huh huh huh huh 
I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest 
I'm strapped moving round with the heat 
I said I do it the best, I'm not the CARDINAL you should test 
That's why my name ring bells in the street 
I put that work in, yeah yeah 
I put that work in, yeah yeah 
I put that work in, yeah yeah

God Gave Me Style,50 Cent,"
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
Listen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault yeah

Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face 
God make me shine like the sun 
God make me shine like the sun 
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style 
I'm hot, I breaks it down 
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down 
The way I break it down 
Listen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly 
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me 
When my CD's drop, they sell the best 
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed 
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams 
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam 
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell 
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell? 
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell 
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl 
Don't much good come from me, but my music 
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah

It ain't my fault, you can't break it down 
The way I break it down 
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself 
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself 
I drift off on a cloud, by myself 
Thinkin bout nothin more, than life - what else? 
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me 
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me 
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day 
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay 
A PERSON told me God's favorites have a hard time 
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind 
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast 
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math 
God gave me style, God gave me grace

If you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
They putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie
Man, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That own_name me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you my dad's fucking crazy
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye
I'm on flight
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
My lawyers on retainers every month, I give ‘em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

End up like X and ORG in my mansion smoking crack 
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me 
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like PERSON 
Man, PERSON won't mix my records, now I need to talk to PERSON 
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi 
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy 
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty 
Why's PERSON rocking that PERSON look, man, isn't he from Marcy? 
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a PERSON

That PERSON me 
ORG found my truck and burnt it up out there in GPE 
You can ask my son, he'll tell you my dad's fucking crazy 
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin hates me 
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me 
I'll blow your fuckin mind out if I told you what he paid me 
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high 
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die 
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try 
You get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye

Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene 
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me 
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit 
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid 
DATE I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case 
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face 
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home 
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on

So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up

Smash the PRODUCT out the stash in the dash an

You won't let GPE pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot 
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch 
From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop 
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street

Gotta Make it to Heaven,50 Cent,"
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood they identify niggas by their cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump thirty shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you round me son
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas
Get close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call Fifty what up?
They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you  in CASAT
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on their back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell

Man, so cial ser vice finna come and take them kids 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I got ta make it to Heav en 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I hope I make it to Heav en 
Lord, grant me the seren i ty to ac cept the things I can not change 
The courage to change the things I can, and the wis dom to know the dif fer ence 
In AA they make you say that 
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you in CASAT 
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens 
But when we come home that don't mean we go ing to fuck ing be friends 
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whis tle 
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pis tol 
In the hood nig gas run ning round act ing crazy 
Buy ing lit tle Air Jor dans for maybe ba bies 
See it might be his and it might be yours 
Be cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores 
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them draw ers 
You can have them on their back or on all fours 
You ain't got to tell me, you feel ing this shit 
Be cause I hear what I'm say ing, I know I'm killing this shit 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I got ta make it to Heav en 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I hope I make it to Heav en 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I got ta make it to Heav en 
I got ta make it to Heav en for go ing through Hell 
I got ta make it to Heav en, I hope I make it to Heav en","

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends 
I been to ORG once, I ain't going again 
First Z got PERSON then PERSON got PERSON 
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt? 
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat 
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that 
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees 
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese 
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's 
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the ORG 
In the hood they identify niggas by their cars 
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar 
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot 
I'll send PERSON to dump CARDINAL shots on your block 
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done 
I'll make you wet niggas if you round me son 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas 
Get close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga 
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass 
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass 
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down 
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground 
Out the blue I get a phone call CARDINAL what up? 
They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up 
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy 
Front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers, boy 
Cousin PERSON shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail 
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail 
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo 
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo blew the hinge off her door 
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib? 
Man, social service finna come and take them kids 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change 
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference 
In AA they make you say that 
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you in LOC 
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens 
But when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends 
The shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle 
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol 
In the hood niggas running round acting crazy 
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies 
See it might be his and it might be yours 
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores 
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers 
You can have them on their back or on all fours 
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit 
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell 
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven"

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, uh huh
So what I keep em rolled up
Saggin my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some five hundred and one's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin grade A
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, its gettin kinda heavy, relevant, sellin it
Dippin away, time keep slippin away
Zip in the safe, flippin for pay
Tippin like I'm drippin in paint
Up front four blunts, like Khalifa put the weed in a J
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon be some weed in the air
Tell em Mac
Blowin everywhere we goin and now you knowin
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-three, hi it's me
This is us, we gon fuss
And we gon fight and we gon roll
And live off life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
So what?

Find how to turn things around 
Now things are lookin up 
From the ground up, pound up, this Tay lor Gang 
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing 
Now I'm chill in', fresh out ta class, feel in 
Like I'm on my own and I could prob a bly own a build ing 
Got my own car, no job, no chil dren

So what we get drunk 
So what we smoke weed 
We're just having fun 
We don't care who sees 
So what we go out 
That's how it's supposed to be 
Living young and wild and free 
Uh, uh huh 
So what I keep em rolled up 
Saggin my pants not caring what I show 
Keep it real with my niggas 
Keep it player for the hoes 
And look clean don't it? 
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it 
Give me some five hundred and one's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers 
And smoke them hoes down till they stingers 
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin grade A 
Yeah, uh you know what? 
It's like I'm CARDINAL again 
Peach fuzz on my face 
Lookin', on the case 
Tryna find a hella taste 
Oh My God, I'm on the chase 
Chevy, its gettin kinda heavy, relevant, sellin it 
Dippin away, time keep slippin away 
Zip in the safe, flippin for pay 
PERSON like I'm drippin in paint 
Up front CARDINAL blunts, like PERSON put the weed in a J 
So what we get drunk 
So what we smoke weed 
We're just having fun 
We don't care who sees 
So what we go out 
That's how it's supposed to be 
Living young and wild and free 
And I don't even care 
Cause if me and my team in there 
There's gon be some weed in the air 
Tell em PERSON 
Blowin everywhere we goin and now you knowin 
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up 
That's how it should be done 
Soon as you thinkin you're down 
Find how to turn things around 
Now things are lookin up 
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang 
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing 
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin 
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building 
Got my own car, no job, no children 
Had a science project, me and PERSON killed it 
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-three, hi it's me 
This is us, we gon fuss 
And we gon fight and we gon roll 
And live off life 
So what we get drunk 
So what we smoke weed 
We're just having fun 
We don't care who sees 
So what we go out 
That's how it's supposed to be 
Living young and wild and free 
Yeah, roll one, smoke one 
When you live like this you're supposed to party 
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun 
So we just, roll one, smoke one 
When you live like this you're supposed to party 
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun 
So what we get drunk 
So what we smoke weed 
We're just having fun 
We don't care who sees 
So what we go out 
That's how it's supposed to be 
Living young and wild and free 
So what? 
Weed, fun, we don't care who sees 
That's how it's supposed to be 
Living young and wild..."
Me And My Homies,Snoop Dogg,"
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies
Me and my homies
Constantly we mash
Me and my homies
Gotta make that cash
Me and my homies
There's no need to ask
Me and my homies
We are still the best
thats my homeys
Thats my homeys

Me and my homies tho 
You know we kick it like everyday 
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday 
But I'm alone in my room 
And I don't have no one to talk to 
I catch a girl with my phone 
And cause some folks who know what I go through 
After I smoke a joint, come on 
To keep my temper low 
I parlay with my friends 
There's really no where else to go 
I ain't shit without my homeboys 
Rather be buried, then see us party 
Keep it close to my heart 
Cause we the ones that got the shit started 
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces 
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches 
All my homeboys are self sufficient 
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks 
Got the police taking our pictures 
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride 
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die 
For each other, cause we closer than brothers 
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping 
When my squad walks in 
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony 
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies 
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets 
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it 
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me 
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies 
Me and my fucking homies 
Me and my homies 
Constantly we mash 
Me and my homies 
Gotta make that cash 
Me and my homies 
There's no need to ask 
Me and my homies 
We are still the best 
thats my homeys 
Thats my homeys 
ORG homeys"
Hi 2 U,Snoop Dogg,"Wassup baby

A nigga sayin hi to you how you doin'?
I really wouldn't lie to you  I ain't lying
I wanna get inside of you mmm
Inside of you yes I do!
What you try to do Can I hit it?
A nigga sayin hi to you how you doin?
I really wouldn't lie to you that's real
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you
 one
Wash my clothes you hoes clean up the kitchen
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them bitches was vicious
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the booty
Oops, slid it on the accident
But, when I first met her she was so innocent
So it made no sense how she suck dick for fuck of it
We did it on the wall, me and my own_name
And I met her at the mall
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you
Make you wanna come back and get another piece
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket
Ride it, devide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you 
 two
Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list
Unless you wanna be the girl that fill that void
And grow with a real G homeboy
I take you where you wanna be
And I strip you buttnaked right in front of me
Think I hop, beauty for that there, can see
On the floor, at the mo gettin low
Two thirty real dirty I we ain't leavin em fo
Close the do and turn off the lights
I love it when you coochie me extra tight
Got you screamin dynamite, like Jay Jay
Hey hey, girl that's what happenen

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you

I had a chick named Shamai, she love champagne
What a little twist the thing Alaine
She wadn't from America, so she couldn't speak English
I wipped out my ?zizag? and baby spoked dinglish
Reminds me of the supper free, that I bumped in Frisco
Same week buzzing another one up in Fresno
Hey ya'knaw, it seems that they knew what time it was
I've got a glass of Hurricane to get them all buzzed
Had them doin all type of craziness
And one freak said All I wanna do is get a homegirl ???
I flipped, for a second, look here I wrecked it
They gotta have that po-po, ?????????
They be we twisted, in case you missed it
See we gone keep this on the DL, It's our lil secret
I won't tell, if you won't tell, see
Cause you gone work your thang, BANG BANG

A nigga sayin hi to you
I wanna be inside of you
I know I'm lookin fly to you
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?
A nigga sayin hi to you
You know I wouldn't lie to you
I wanna be inside of you
And after I do, goodbye to you

A nigga sayin hi to you how you doin?

Wash my clothes you hoes clean up the kitchen 
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes 
You get CARDINAL wishes if you're cute and ambitious 
Like PERSON and Denisha, boy them bitches was vicious 
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the booty 
Oops, slid it on the accident 
But, when I ORDINAL met her she was so innocent 
So it made no sense how she suck PERSON for fuck of it 
We did it on the wall, me and my PERSON 
And I met her at the mall 
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you 
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you 
Make you wanna come back and get another piece 
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece 
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket 
Ride it, devide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it 

A nigga sayin hi to you 
I wanna be inside of you 
I know I'm lookin fly to you 
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do?

Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like PERSON girl 
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world 
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools 
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish 
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list 
Unless you wanna be the girl that fill that void 
And grow with a real G homeboy 
I take you where you wanna be 
And I strip you buttnaked right in front of me 
Think I hop, beauty for that there, can see 
On the floor, at the mo gettin low 
CARDINAL CARDINAL real dirty I we ain't leavin em fo 
Close the do and turn off the lights 
I love it when you coochie me extra tight 
Got you screamin dynamite, like Jay Jay 
Hey hey, girl that's what happenen 

A nigga sayin hi to you 
I wanna be inside of you 
I know I'm lookin fly to you 
I wouldn't lie to you, what am I to do? 
A nigga sayin hi to you 
You know I wouldn't lie to you 
I wanna be inside of you 
And after I do, goodbye to you 
CARDINAL 
I had a chick named Shamai, she love champagne 
What a little twist the thing Alaine 
She wadn't from America, so she couldn't speak LANGUAGE 
I wipped out my ?zizag? and baby spoked dinglish 
Reminds me of the supper free, that I bumped in GPE 
Same week buzzing another one up in GPE 
Hey ya'knaw, it seems that they knew what time it was 
I've got a glass of Hurricane to get them all buzzed 
Had them doin all type of craziness 
And CARDINAL freak said All I wanna do is get a homegirl ??? 
I flipped, for a second, look here I wrecked it 
They gotta have that po-po, ????????? 
They be we twisted, in case you missed it 
See we gone keep this on the DL, It's our lil secret 
I won't tell, if you won't tell, see 
Cause you gone work your thang, BANG BANG 

A nigga sayin hi to you 
I wanna be inside of you

Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the paper's long
But as for me my only G is when I'm buss'n rocks
Now when I wake up in the morining

Cause I still can give it up for you {What up cuz}

But own_name Pound}
Cuz were all a little strong
In the beach where the papers long
But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that}
You know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool
I was a muthafuckin fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth
And it'll catch on
Cuz if it don't it's on
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone
Sittin back laughin in the chronic zone
Clown me, you're wrong
Surround me, you're gone
And it's the same old song
Nigga paper so long
They own_name Capone
So if you want me, get him, got him
Shoot him, shot him
But own_name Gotti
And that's all I LBC betta yet
That's all I DPGC

Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin

But I'll put her on a hoe stroller, make me some green
And even if she never even saw me before

Cause my game's unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

Cuz were all a little strong 
In the beach where the paper's long 
But as for me my only G is when I'm buss'n rocks 
Now when I wake up in the morining

But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that} 
You know you gotta have heart 
I told you niggas from the start 
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life 
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight 
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool 
I was a muthafuckin fool 
I had to have papers it was routine 
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens 
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves 
For fuckin with my wealth 
And it'll catch on 
Cuz if it don't it's on 
And cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone 
Sittin back laughin in the chronic zone 
Clown me, you're wrong 
Surround me, you're gone 
And it's the same old song 
Nigga paper so long 
They John Capone 
So if you want me, get him, got him 
Shoot him, shot him 
But John Gotti 
And that's all I LBC betta yet 
That's all I DPGC

I do it to you real hard then it gets harder
It's nada - thang on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?
Who's that dippin in the Cadillac? own_name
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts own_name
Who got a girl layin on her back? own_name
Who's that makin that paper stack? own_name
You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin em props whattup, whattup
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin no bullshittin
We be sittin, in the corner
With smoke comin from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin up the charts burnin up the charts
Break a bitch heart, lil mama don't you start

D-O-double-gi-zee, D-O-double-gi-zee!
Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop till we blow up ka-boom!
Now every lil bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, groovin to this
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this ahh!
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say..
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets

It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo 
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho-maniac 
Bring it back, now shake it up 
Put it on the table, now break it up 
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it 
It really don't matter what you spent on it 
As long as you're gettin what you paid for 
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for? 
Who's that dippin in the Cadillac? John 
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts PERSON 
Who got a girl layin on her back? PERSON 
Who's that makin that paper stack? PERSON

Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong

No snap shots cause I might get popped 
As I slide by security, givin em props whattup, PERSON

Let me take you back to when I ORDINAL slid in 
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in 
Put my bid in, no bullshittin no bullshittin

Don't need foreplay, okay, obey

Yo, what's up, John? 
Hey, John down? 
What's up G-John? 
Oh, nothing, trying to live between the sky and LOC and ain’t touching dirt nowhere, man 
Right, right 
I'm fucked about right about now PERSON 
I'm about ready to get up out this, damn 
I'm ready to get his shit up, man 
With the motherfucking law after me 
Punk-ass bitches, sucka-ass niggas 
I can't take this shit no more dog 
What? Man, you want to get out the game? Come on man 
You can smoke a pound of bud everyday 
You got a big screen TV, man, you wanna give all this up? 
You got the dopest shit out on the streets 
Nigga, is you crazy? That's the NORP Dream, nigga 
Well, ain't it? 
Fool, you better come on in

Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed 
You better quit fucking with me 
Smoke inhale 
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker 
Like we always do about this time"
Watch Dem Niggas,Nas,"
They own_name decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'll be sticking you
The Mag inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Now, how can I perfect this? Uhh, what?
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing ninety on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from the Apollo
My fuck tomorrow motto through the eyes of Pablo
own_name, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Some niggas watch you uhh
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, Where's the hundred grand?"", strippin her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you uhh
And make sure they do what they supposed to do what, hah
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you uh
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you uhh
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you uh-huh
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways uhh)",nan,male,song,"

They own_ name de ci sive 
It's just the like ness of Is raelites mist that made me write this 
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chas ing down your prime time 
Food for thought or rather mind wine 
The Don Juan fea tures the freak shit 
My the sis on how we creep quick 
Fuck ing your wife, that ain't no se cret 
It's manda to ry, see that pussy, they hand it to me 
I got no game, it's just some bitch es un der stand my sto ry 
There ain't no dra ma that my nig gas nev er han dle for me 
My gator brand is Mau ri, walk ing through rough land be fore me 
Where the snakes put a smile on they face 
Hop ing and pray ing I'm stuck 
Scop ing, they lay in the cut, weigh ing my luck 
Play er haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages 
Wink ing at some fe males cops with cocked gauges 
Re al ly, it's pa pers I'm ad dict ed to 
Was n't for rap, then I'll be stick ing you 
The Mag in side the Triple Goose 
Face down on the floor's the rou tine 
Don't want hear no body blow steam 
Just cream or it's a smoke screen 
Imag ine that, that's why I hard ly kick the brag ging raps 
I zone, to each his own and this ghet to in hab i tant

And make sure they do what they sup posed to do 
Cause you know they be think ing bout smok ing you 
Nev er per son al, nowa days, it's the ways 
Now, how can I per fect this? Uh h, what? 
Liv ing reck less, die for my neck lace 
Crime in fect ed, driv ing a Lexus with a death wish 
Jet ting, check ing my mes sage on the speak er 
Bop ping to Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa 
CD crank ing, do ing nine ty on the Franklin D. Roo sevelt 
No seat belt, drink ing and think ing 
My man caught a bad one, son, nig gas is fright ened 
Se cret in dict ments, as on to one seek ing en light en ment 
My Mova do says sev en, the God hour, that's if you fol low 
Tra di tions start ed by the school, not far from the Apol lo 
My fuck to mor row mot to through the eyes of Pablo

See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you 
You swore to keep it re al af ter you blow 
Three keys, new V's, went to An guil la with your ho 
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat get ting the dough 
Them old timers ad vise you to them prob lems that's ahead 
Dra ma with the Fed s, not lis ten ing, just bob bing your head 
Your Rol lie shin ing, think ing to your self no body's tak ing mine 
At the same time, your ho is get ting snatched from be hind 
Put in a van, Where's the hun dred grand?"", strip pin her hand 
From all the ice, would n't you know 
You knew these nig gas all your life

You fucked up some where down the line 
Now they had to tar get your Wis dom 
She took em to your place, straight to your safe 
You doubt ed it could hap pen, sick of yap ping 
Jump in your ride, head ed to your side

Should n't have your stash house where you crash out 
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out 
Dead bitch es tell no lies, you should use your eyes

They PERSON decisive 
It's just the likeness of NORP mist that made me write this 
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime 
Food for thought or rather mind wine 
The Don Juan features the freak shit 
My thesis on how we creep quick 
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret 
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me 
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story 
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me 
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me 
Where the snakes put a smile on they face 
Hoping and praying I'm stuck 
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck 
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages 
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges 
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to 
Wasn't for rap, then I'll be sticking you 
The ORG inside the Triple Goose 
Face down on the floor's the routine 
Don't want hear nobody blow steam 
Just cream or it's a smoke screen 
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps 
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant 
Watch NORP niggas that be close to you 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
Watch NORP niggas that be close to you 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
Now, how can I perfect this? Uhh, what? 
Living reckless, die for my necklace 
Crime infected, driving a ORG with a death wish 
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker 
Bopping to Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, CARDINAL G's, gun and my ORG 
CD cranking, doing CARDINAL on the Franklin D. Roosevelt 
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking 
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened 
Secret indictments, as on to CARDINAL seeking enlightenment 
My PRODUCT says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow 
Traditions started by the school, not far from the ORG 
My fuck DATE motto through the eyes of PERSON 
John, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato 
Gotta watch NORP niggas that's close to you 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
Watch NORP niggas that's close to you 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
Some niggas watch you uhh 
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you 
You swore to keep it real after you blow 
CARDINAL keys, new V's, went to LOC with your ho 
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough 
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead 
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head 
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine 
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind 
Put in a van, Where's the hundred grand?"", PERSON her hand 
From all the ice, wouldn't you know 
You knew these niggas all your life 
What made them mark you victim? 
You fucked up somewhere down the line 
Now they had to target your Wisdom 
She took em to your place, straight to your safe 
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping 
Jump in your ride, headed to your side 
Puffin ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder 
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out 
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out 
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes 
Gotta watch NORP niggas that's close to you uhh 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do what, hah 
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you uh 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways 
Watch NORP niggas that's close to you uhh 
And make sure they do what they supposed to do 
Cause you know they be thinking bout smoking you uh-huh 
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways uhh)"

A mastermind sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones
A mastermind everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical
Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones
A mastermind everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, drive home
Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said Goodbye
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since eighty-two
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon be
But I'm a mastermind
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones
A mastermind everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last fifteen minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones
A mastermind everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
A mastermind sleeps at night real easy
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book
A mastermind never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical",nan,male,song,"

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh... 
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes 
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones 
A mastermind everything planned out perfect 
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
A mastermind sleeps at TIME real easy 
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book 
A mastermind never do a thing irrational 
Lives forever, these tales are classical 
Velvet bow ties 
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by 
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds 
And my principal is to study drama 
Look what happened in GPE 
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin 
CARDINAL of my dogs fell, CARDINAL of my niggas ran 
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man 
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand 
And how the weak end up in a coffin 
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man 
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man 
Make your enemies believe there's love there 
Cause in war, belief is all fair 
Rock them to sleep, shots in your ORG 
And you ain't never know the plot was from me 
It's from my masterminds 
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes 
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones 
A mastermind everything planned out perfect 
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
A mastermind sleeps at TIME real easy 
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book 
A mastermind never do a thing irrational 
Lives forever, these tales are classical 
It ain't a game it's the life 
Think it's a game, you lame 
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot 
Toast to my hero Nat Turner 
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis 
Whispered in her earlobe, drive home 
Cause she the wife and they the freaks 
The underneath my girl caliber 
They smiled at her and said Goodbye 
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us 
My bodyguards in my ORG truck 
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs 
That I don't really get down with 
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks 
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link 
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth 
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups 
The main nigga Sonny had big money since DATE 
Had CARDINAL of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do 
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that 
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel PERSON was wrong 
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep 
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon be 
But I'm a mastermind 
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes 
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones 
A mastermind everything planned out perfect 
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
A mastermind sleeps at TIME real easy 
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book 
A mastermind never do a thing irrational 
Lives forever, these tales are classical 
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable 
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you 
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine 
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find 
This King of New York shit only last fifteen minutes 
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it 
ORG who brilliant, came in and killed it 
Made CARDINAL every three months, new jury 
I'm low, smoking PERSON with a ho 
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it 
Squares, they into voodoo 
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who 
Would come and try to kill you too 
A mastermind sees it coming before it comes 
A mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones 
A mastermind everything planned out perfect 
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered 
A mastermind sleeps at TIME real easy 
A mastermind cause everything he does is by the book 
A mastermind never do a thing irrational 
Lives forever, these tales are classical"
Wanna Play (Rough?),Nas,"
Yo, the Lord is my shepard
The sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son
Cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit me when I say duct tape em?
Fuck waitin
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin wit Satan
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin off his waves with a chipped tooth
Is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin
Okay, you wanna play rough?!
gun shots scratching - a thug changes, and love changes
Okay yo, we could play rough!
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat?  are they lookin for me?
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-eleven Glock spits seventeen shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas thats tryin to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into
Walked in his house, smackin him up, what you talkin about? he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin with me, you should've known
I'll have em write stupid nigga on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin you niggas with nothin
Left him dead, engine runnin
You the only I'm makin sure that gets whats comin
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin eatin by rats
Gettin even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
a cop man"", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......
Okay, so we gonna play rough!

Yo, the Lord is my shepard 
The sword is my weapon 
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle 
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son 
Cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun 
Before they choose an education 
But once dead their ain't no awakenin 
So like once said, life ain't for fakin 
Yo, you wit me when I say duct tape em? 
Fuck waitin 
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation 
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin wit Satan 
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assasination 
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a PERSON 
Rocks his hat sideways, showin off his waves with a chipped tooth 
Is this the truth? 
This is what we do, sip a brew 
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM 
As soon as he walks in the door we slay em 
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin 
Okay, you wanna play rough?! 
gun shots scratching - a thug changes, and love changes 
Okay yo, we could play rough! 
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough? 
Who these niggas tryin to hide in their truck 
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas 
Ducked in they seat? are they lookin for me? 
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought 
I slept like ORG and PERSON did 
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit 
P-eleven Glock spits CARDINAL shot clips 
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is 
Pull the strap from under the seat 
Back up in the street 
Watch these niggas thats tryin to watch me, I carefully creep 
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin my heat 
Empty every shell in their direction 
Its you, I should've guessed it! 
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you 
Now ORG take you off here, you dont know what you got into 
Walked in his house, smackin him up, what you talkin about? he said 
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome 
Never thought I'd be in his home 
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone 
NORP with me, you should've known 
I'll have em write stupid nigga on your tombstone 
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G 
For threatenin me 
ORG do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free 
PERSON you niggas with nothin 
Left him dead, engine runnin 
You the only I'm makin sure that gets whats comin 
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault 
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it 
But before I let you have it I'm searchin your crib 
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live 
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back 
I'll be right up in his ass to blow em out with the PERSON 
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that? 
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin eatin by rats 
Gettin even's never wrong, its only right to react 
Eye for an eye, cause the sweetest part is payback 
Somebody kncokin', who dat? 
a cop man"", let him in 
And give that mothafucka one under the chin 
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds! 
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead 
Dont explain, I put the pound on his head 
Blew em! before that I can't remember the last time I said...... 
Okay, so we gonna play rough!"
Halftime,Nas,"
Right… Right…
Check me out y'all
own_name in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
forty-side is the place that is givin me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
own_name, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime
Right… It's halftime
Right… Ayo it's halftime
Right… It's halftime
Right… Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In own_name wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson five
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
own_name has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparkin
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore own_name that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime
Right… It's halftime
Right… Exhale, check it, it's halftime
Right… It's halftime
Right… It's real in the field
Word life, check it
I got it goin on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin them fast, doin this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin hits on five-zero
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the forty-four
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
Right… It's still halftime
Right… To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
Right… ninety-two, it's halftime
Right… Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime…",nan,male,song,"

Right… Right… 
Check me out y'all 
own_ name in your area 
About to cause mass hys te ria 
Be fore a blunt, I take out my fronts 
Then I start to fron t, mat ter of fact I be on a man hunt 
You could n't catch me in the streets with out a ton of reefer 
That's like Mal colm X catchin the Jun gle Fever 
King po et ic, too much fla vor, I'm ma jor 
At lanta ain't Brave r, I'll pull a num ber like a pager 
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass 
forty  side is the place that is givin me grace 
Now wait, an oth er dose and you might be dead 
And I'm a Nike  head, I wear chains that ex cite the feds 
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a per former, strange 
So the mic warmer was born to gain 
own_ name, why did you do it? 
You know you got the mad phat flu id when you rhyme 
It's half time 
Right… It's half time 
Right… Ayo it's half time 
Right… It's half time 
Right… Yeah, it's about half time 
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel 
It's like that, you know it's like that 
I got it hemmed, now you nev er get the mic back 
When I at tack, there ain't a army that could strike back 
So I re act nev er calm ly on a hype track 
I set it off with my own rhyme 
‘Cause I'm as ill as a con vict who kills for phone time 
I'm max like cas settes, I flex like sex 
In own_ name wreck 
I used to hus tle, now all I do is re lax and strive 
When I was young I was a fan of the Jack son five 
I drop jew el s, wear jew el s, hope to nev er run it 
With more kicks than a ba by in a moth er's stom ach 
own_ name has to rise ‘cause I'm wise 
This is ex er cise til the mi cro phone dies 
Back in eighty three I was an MC sparkin 
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and 
Kick my lit tle raps ‘cause I thought nig gas would n't un der stand 
And now in ev ery jam I'm the fuckin man 
I rap in front of more nig gas than in the slave ships 
I used to watch CHiP s"", now I load Glock clips 
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Mag ic 
Ver sa tile, my style switch es like a fag got 
But not bi sex u al, I'm an in tel lec tu al 
Of rap I'm a pro fes sion al, and that's no ques tion yo 
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, un der stand? 
‘Cause in the streets I'm well  known like the num ber man 
Am I in place with the bass and for mat? 
Ex plore own_ name that 
And next time I rhyme, I be foul 
When ev er I freestyle I see tri al, nig gas say I'm wild 
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme 
Stay tuned, I as sume, the re al rap comes at half time 
Right… It's half time 
Right… Ex hale, check it, it's half time 
Right… It's half time 
Right… It's re al in the field 
Word life, check it 
I got it goin on, even flip a morn ing song 
Ev ery af ter noon, I kick half the tune 
And in the dark ness I'm heart less like when the NAR C's hit 
Word to Mar cus Gar vey, I hard ly sparked it 
‘Cause when I blast the her b, that's my word 
I be slayin them fast, doin this that and the third 
But chill, pass the An dre, and let's slay 
I bag bitch es up at John Jay and hit a mati nee 
Puttin hits on five ze ro 
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the forty  four 
And biters can't come near 
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Gar cia 
I won't plant seed s, don't need an ex tra mouth I can't feed 
That's ex tra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed 
This goes out to Man hat tan, the is land of Stat en 
Brook lyn and Queens is livin fat and 
The Boo gie Down, enough prop s, enough clout 
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out 
Right… It's still half time 
Right… To the Queens bridge crew 
To the Queens bridge crew, you know it's half time 
Right… nine ty t wo, it's half time 
Right… Yo po lice, po lice man, yo let's get ghost 
Half time…","

Right… Right… 
Check me out y'all 
PERSON in your area 
About to cause mass hysteria 
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts 
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt 
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer 
That's like Malcolm X catchin the Jungle Fever 
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major 
GPE ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager 
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass 
forty-side is the place that is givin me grace 
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead 
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds 
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange 
So the mic warmer was born to gain 
John, why did you do it? 
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme 
It's halftime 
Right… It's halftime 
Right… PERSON it's halftime 
Right… It's halftime 
Right… Yeah, it's about halftime 
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel 
It's like that, you know it's like that 
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back 
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back 
So I react never calmly on a hype track 
I set it off with my own rhyme 
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time 
I'm PERSON like cassettes, I flex like sex 
In John wreck 
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive 
When I was young I was a fan of the PERSON five 
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it 
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach 
PERSON has to rise ‘cause I'm wise 
This is exercise til the microphone dies 
Back in DATE I was an MC sparkin 
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and 
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand 
And now in every jam I'm the NORP man 
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships 
I used to watch CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips 
I got to have it, I miss Mr. PERSON 
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot 
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual 
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo 
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand? 
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man 
Am I in place with the bass and format? 
Explore PERSON that 
And next time I rhyme, I be foul 
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild 
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme 
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime 
Right… It's halftime 
Right… Exhale, check it, it's halftime 
Right… It's halftime 
Right… It's real in the field 
Word life, check it 
I got it goin on, even flip a morning song 
Every afternoon, I kick CARDINAL the tune 
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit 
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it 
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word 
I be slayin them fast, doin this that and the ORDINAL 
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay 
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee 
ORG hits on CARDINAL 
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the forty-four 
And biters can't come near 
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot PERSON 
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed 
That's extra PERSON change, more cash for damp weed 
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of GPE 
GPE and GPE is livin fat and 
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout 
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out 
Right… It's still halftime 
Right… To the Queensbridge crew 
To the ORG crew, you know it's halftime 
Right… ninety-two, it's halftime 
Right… Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost 
Halftime…"
Roses,Nas,"
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more",nan,male,song,"

Just like a rose 
Ev ery body knows that you are so beau ti ful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't re pair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
I should've left your ros es at the door 
They're sharp er than be fore 
And I don't want them no more 
I should've left your ros es at the door 
They're sharp er than be fore 
And I don't need them no more 
I have no time to give you guid ance 
Bare ly have any fuck time ei ther 
Hefn er mind ed like I think you're fine, but 
I seen the finest wom en that ev er came out a beaver 
Mind read er, can tell she ve g an or not when I meet her 
Or if she in se cure, most are 
If she's mixed, a pos si ble psy cho alert goes off 
Not a judge, cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he al lows 
Ev ery thing to go to your spouse when you end your vows 
My tax brack et, not enough blacks have it 
Who should I date    Project chick or Cuban ac tress? 
A White chick, they might flip talk ing that Black ness 
Should on ly at tract Black shit, I'm an ass mag net 
If you mad at that, you'll be mad for ev er 
Nev er played you, I prayed we would stay to geth er 
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean 
Heard you tear a rose from the root s, the rose screams 
Just like a rose 
Ev ery body knows that you are so beau ti ful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't re pair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
Them Xanax can't man age your ma ni ac man ic de pres sive ex pres sions 
They some silent killer s, that stress shit 
That put ul cers in a lot of nig gas 
I'm blow ing med i cal, it helps chill a vi o lent tem per 
I done went to hell and back, you al ways think you right 
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight 
When peo ple like my song, you want to kill em, right? 
You re sent me ev ery time I make a mil lion, right? 
You want to ex pe ri ence life when you call ing all the shots 
Or der ing bot tles for all your girls up in the spot 
Have your own cash, own your own Benz 
Your own house, ev ery thing, me I un der stand 
Thought you would bask in the glo ry as Queen Bee 
Put you on un der Mar tin Scors ese Mean Street 
The first movie he made, thought that was fly 
I thought you was fly er, you a fuck ing liar 
Just like a rose 
Ev ery body knows that you are so beau ti ful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't re pair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
I should've left your ros es at the door 
They're sharp er than be fore 
And I don't want them no more 
I should've left your ros es at the door

Just like a rose 
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't repair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
I should've left your roses at the door 
They're sharper than before 
And I don't want them no more 
I should've left your roses at the door 
They're sharper than before 
And I don't need them no more 
I have no time to give you guidance 
Barely have any fuck time either 
ORG minded like I think you're fine, but 
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver 
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her 
Or if she insecure, most are 
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off 
Not a judge, cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows 
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows 
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it 
Who should I date -- Project chick or NORP actress? 
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness 
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet 
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever 
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together 
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean 
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams 
Just like a rose 
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't repair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions 
They some silent killers, that stress shit 
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas 
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper 
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right 
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight 
When people like my song, you want to kill em, right? 
You resent me every time I make a million, right? 
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots 
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot 
Have your own cash, own your own ORG 
Your own house, everything, me I understand 
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee 
Put you on under Martin Scorsese Mean Street 
The ORDINAL movie he made, thought that was fly 
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar 
Just like a rose 
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful 
But I feel a thorn on my hide 
I should've known 
We can't repair what we broke 
But I held you close, too close 
I should've left your roses at the door 
They're sharper than before 
And I don't want them no more 
I should've left your roses at the door 
They're sharper than before 
And I don't need them no more"
N.Y. State of Mind Pt. II,Nas,"
Uhh.. yo
Whattup? Whattup?
It's time man word, it's time?
Straight up it's time, man
Aight, set that shit off set it off then, nigga
Set it off set if off
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin for air til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
seven turned to six niggas, got two in heaven
six of us holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped, five niggas went to four quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', four niggas still hangin
Years passin and slang changin'—three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin out to the death for these ends
What?
New York, New York New York state of mind
New York, New York New York state of mind
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news ""Get money!""
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase aight?
You know what I mean?
New York state of mind, baby oh, yeah
Check it out yeah
I'm at the gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin my lungs
Hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin
New York, New York

Uhh.. yo 
Whattup? Whattup? 
It's time man word, it's time? 
Straight up it's time, man 
Aight, set that shit off set it off then, nigga 
Set it off set if off 
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors 
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors 
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator 
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block 
GPE cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin 
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin 
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans 
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart? 
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog 
To my building—come out later wearin camouflage 
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men 
Niggas gaspin for air til they move no more and just stare 
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet 
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews 
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant 
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested 
Had CARDINALCARDINAL partners growin up, CARDINALCARDINAL turned to CARDINAL 
CARDINAL turned to CARDINAL niggas, got CARDINAL in heaven 
CARDINAL of us holdin it, now it's five rollin thick 
The ORDINAL one's parole flipped, CARDINAL niggas went to CARDINAL quick 
When he went O.T., college life 
Converted into gangbangin', CARDINAL niggas still hangin 
Years passin and slang changin'—three of us now, ORDINAL nigga ain't around 
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit 
Fake shit—beat his ass down 
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown 
All I got left in the end is CARDINAL of my best friends 
And we all goin out to the death for these ends 
What? 
New York, New York New York state of mind 
New York, New York New York state of mind 
You heard about it, you see about it 
You read about it, it's in your papers 
It's in your DATE news ""Get money!"" 
New York chronicles, every day 
The crime rate, the murder rate 
The money rate, the paper chase aight? 
You know what I mean? 
New York state of mind, baby oh, yeah 
Check it out yeah 
I'm at the gamblin spot, my hands on a knot 
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in CARDINAL spot 
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox 
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox 
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along 
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin my lungs 
Hoodrats flashin they tongue 
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations 
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation 
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues 
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave 
Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit 
Stick yo ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks 
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas 
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you 
Some of these dudes the NORP be on em, you knew em for DATE 
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers 
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears 
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid 
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids 
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live 
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down LOC 
Comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths 
All of a sudden we got ORG and Bloods, D.T.'s 
Runnin round quick to split your mug, it's easy 
To score but it's hard to get the shit off 
Niggas fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off 
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell 
Niggas mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale 
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors 
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver 
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin 
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin 
New York, New York 
New York, New York"
Nastradamus,Nas,"
Uh, two thousand G
Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring em
Century twenty-one solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let own_name is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh

Now he is own_nametradamus
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-eleven's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with one hundred gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back 
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that 
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat 
Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring em 
Century twenty-one solar eclipse 
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc 
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet 
GPE is my heat, everyday in the street til I lay six feet 
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps 
Jewelry, cars and PRODUCT is my motto 
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles 
Pop bottles with those who left here 
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years 
The aim for the head and chest years 
What's your name? Make your name known 
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

Let PERSON is 
I was the ORDINAL one on that PERSON shit 
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit 
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips 
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch 
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell 
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels 
Hood rats and bullet wound up females 
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail 
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips 
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit 
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills 
Our honies wearing PERSON high heels 
She come to scoop me, I chill 
Leave the streets alone for a ORG 
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech

Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne 
And we gon rep it the best that we can 
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man 
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and PERSON now 
Where ORG put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend 
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven 
But that's another level, brethren 
CARDINAL G's, we got the type fam with ORG 
We do squeeze, thought it's not right 
But that's the zone that we left in 
Bentleys, Porches, PERSON watches 
Sick with the bread, ORG trucks topless 
Laptops with one hundred gigabytes, ninja bikes 
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice 
And how does CARDINAL guy multiply to more than five wise guys? 
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

I'm irritated, you bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin straight into a fuckin barrel like Sharon Tate
Raise the concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you cause you’re on a flight too, but it’s a staircase
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go

Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo

Stop dwelling, then stop yelling
I'm not yelling, you're yelling
Smart-aleck, goddammit
Fuck is that? Stop hammering Goddamn
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics will get slain
Life, it will strangle you with bicycle chain
You’re gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie Yup
Can't get a fuckin word in, edgewise Shut up
Success overnight like a red-eye Bitch
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers

Hailie’s Song,Eminem,"
Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin sing
‘Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
Some days I sit starin out the window
Watchin this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
‘Cause sometimes Fuck it feels like I was scared the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps gettin older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't 
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin' three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin can take her from me
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin nowhere, baby
I love you ​​)​​",nan,male,song,"

Da-da, PERSON 
Yo, I can't sing, but 
I feel like singing 
I wanna fuckin sing 
‘Cause I'm happy 
Yeah, I'm happy 
I got my baby back 
Yo, check it out 
Some days I sit starin out the window 
ORG this world pass me by 
Sometimes I think there's nothin to live for 
I almost break down and cry 
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy 
Why am I here? Am I just wastin my time? 
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy 
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no 
‘Cause sometimes Fuck it feels like I was scared the world's on my shoulders 
Everyone's leanin on me 
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over 
But then she comes back to me 
My baby girl keeps gettin older 
I watch her grow up with pride 
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me 
They just don't see my real side 
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy 
My insecurities could eat me alive 
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy 
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no 
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders 
Everyone's leanin on me 
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over 
But then she comes back to me 
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin this song to my daughter 
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin as long as my father 
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her 
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't 
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona 
That I'm a pistol-packin drug addict who bags on his momma 
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul 
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow 
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold 
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin 
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? 
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself 
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell 
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt 
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else 
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted 
So here's what I'm facin' CARDINAL felonies, six years of probation 
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman 
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman 
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in? 
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin 
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more 
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore 
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya 
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner 
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted 
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and— 
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders 
Everyone's leanin on me 
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier 
Nothin can take her from me 
Wooo! Told you I can't sing 
Oh, well—I tried 
Hailie, member when I said 
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there? 
Guess what—Daddy's here 
And I ain't goin nowhere, baby 
I love you ​​)​​"
Bagpipes from Baghdad,Eminem,"
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin
I ain't playin no fuckin more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin your bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin you
Titty-fuckin you til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate em and stitch em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy! chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman
Holding a Glad bag, oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man 
How can I describe the way I feel? 
Fucking great, man 
Okay, let me see 
How could I begin? 
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch 
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch 
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch 
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch 
Mariah, what ever happened to us? 
Why did we have to break up? 
All I asked for was a glass of punch 
You see, I never really asked for much 
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such 
A nasty break-up with that NORP hunk 
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up 
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk 
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk 
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk 
PERSON and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk 
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya 
You can beat me with any spatula that you want 
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt 
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk 
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood 
So prepare your vernacular for PERSON acupuncture 
PERSON from GPE 
When will it ever cease? 
For Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least 
PERSON from GPE 
What's going through my mind 
CARDINAL the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like 
PERSON from GPE 
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 
Cause I'm gone, blowing on my 
PERSON from GPE 
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad 
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture 
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster 
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around 
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow 
Man, what an ensemble 
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals 
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my 
Cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle 
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma 
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya 
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin Red Sonja 
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, PERSON 
You're so fuckin annoyin', drop the shovel, boy 
You don't know what the fuck you're doin 
I ain't playin no fuckin more 
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin whore 
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on ORG 
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn 
Shuck o', shuck o corn, Chaka Khan 
Hit PERSON in the face with a hockey puck, and 
Told him it's fuckin on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'? 
You're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower 
Blowin your bagpipes from GPE 
PERSON from GPE

Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 
Cause I'm gone, blowing on my 
PERSON from GPE 
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag 
In the bed with CARDINAL brain-dead lesbian vegetables 
I bet you they become heterosexual 
Nothing will stop me from molestin you 
Titty-fuckin you til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles 
Is what I said to the CARDINAL conjoined twins 
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend? 
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment 
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip 
I just got my DATE sobriety coin chip 
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get? 
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with 
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip 
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit 
And attempt to separate em and stitch em back at the loin, shit 
Lure the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy! chip 
Cookie, lookie, even took me a ORG pic

Hi! Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
own_name starts with E, better check the spellin
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep I don't feel it
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin crazy – hello, hi!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy
I'm ice-grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm own_name gym
I'm own_name alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin my girlfriends
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy – listen
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks! I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol three, and talk about how violent I'll be RRARRRRH
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a seven hundred and forty-seven jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shred the skin
Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!
It's probably AIDS! Forget it then.
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And own_name Rawkus
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy – hello?!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy
Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
own_name, I think that's my name
Rawkus Records, fuckin crazy
Do you hear us? We're fuckin crazy!
All of us! Hi… bye… goodnight, somethin'",nan,male,song,"

Hi! Orig i nal Bad Boy on the case, cov er your face 
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace 
I laced the weed with in sect re pel lan t, bet ter check the smelly 
own_ name starts with E, bet ter check the spellin 
With a cap i tal, some body grab me a Snap ple 
I got an as pirin cap sule trapped in my Adam's ap ple 
Some body dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure 
That my moth er did it, but the bitch won't ad mit it was her 
I slit her stom ach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
And said I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feel in these kick s, cun t? 
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
I'll prob a bly have a cell next to the fur nace in Hell 
I'm sick er than sperm cells with syphilis germs 
And I'm hot ter than my dick is when I piss and it burns 
I kick you in the tum my un til you sick to your stom ach 
And vom it so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it 
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plum met 
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it 
And all that gib ber ish you was spit tin', you need to kill it 
‘Cause your style is like dy ing in my sleep I don't feel it 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pill s, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Huh? 
Is fuckin crazy – hel lo, hi! 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
I'm ice  grillin you, starin you down with a grem lin grin 
I'm own_ name gym 
I'm own_ name alias 
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens 
A braini ac, with a cra ni um packed 
Full of more ura ni um than a ma ni ac Sau di Ara bi an 
A high ly com bustible head 
Spas mat ic, strapped to a Craft mat ic ad justable bed 
Laid up in the hos pi tal in crit i cal con di tion 
I flat lined, jumped up, and ran from the mor ti cian 
High speed, IV full of Thai weed 
Lookin Chi nese with my knees stuck to geth er like Siamese 
Twin s, joined at the groin like les bians 
Uh h, pins and needles, hy po der mic nee dles and pins 
I hope God for gives me for my sins 
It prob a bly all de pends on if I keep on killin my girl friends 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pill s, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy – lis ten 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mush rooms and dust 
And got rushed to the hos pi tal to get my sys tem flushed 
Shuck s! I'm an al co holic, and that's all I can say 
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frol ic and play 
I swal low grenades, and take about a bot tle a day 
Of Tylenol three, and talk about how vi o lent I'll be RRAR RRRH 
Give me eleven Ex cedrin, my head 'll spin 
Medicine'll get me revvin like a sev en hun dred and forty  sev en jet en gine 
Scratched my balls til I shred the skin 
Doc tor, check this rash! Look how red it's been! 
It's prob a bly AID S! For get it then. 
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
That don't even make sense, like dykes us ing dil dos 
So reach in your bill folds for ten ducats 
And own_ name Rawkus 
Some thin', some thin', some thin', some thin', I get weed ed. 
My daugh ter scrib bled over that rhyme, I could n't read it 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pill s, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy – hel lo?! 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a mini van 
For twen ty grand, a bot tle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
Hi, some thing's not right 
I'm sor ry, I'm men tal ly re tard ed 
own_ name, I think that's my name 
Rawkus Record s, fuckin crazy 
Do you hear us? We're fuckin crazy! 
All of us! Hi… bye… good night, some thin'","

Hi! Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face 
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace 
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly 
PERSON starts with E, better check the spellin 
With a capital, somebody grab me a ORG 
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple 
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure 
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her 
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
And said I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin these kicks, cunt? 
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell 
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs 
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns 
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach 
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it 
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet 
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it 
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it 
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep I don't feel it 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Huh? 
Is fuckin crazy – hello, hi! 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
I'm ice-grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin 
I'm John gym 
I'm John alias 
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens 
A brainiac, with a cranium packed 
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
A highly combustible head 
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed 
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician 
High speed, IV full of NORP weed 
Lookin Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese 
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians 
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
I hope PERSON forgives me for my sins 
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin my girlfriends 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy – listen 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust 
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
Shucks! I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say 
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play 
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
Of ORG three, and talk about how violent I'll be RRARRRRH 
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin 
Medicine'll get me revvin like a seven hundred and forty-seven jet engine 
Scratched my balls til I shred the skin 
Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been! 
It's probably AIDS! Forget it then. 
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos 
So reach in your billfolds for CARDINAL ducats 
And John Rawkus 
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded. 
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy – hello?! 
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin crazy 
Hi, something's not right 
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded 
John, I think that's my name 
Rawkus Records, NORP crazy 
Do you hear us? We're fuckin crazy! 
All of us! Hi… bye… goodnight, somethin'"
97' Bonnie & Clyde,Eminem,"
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
Just the two of us, just the two of us
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
Just the two of us, just the two of us
I would never give you up for nothin
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it No
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? Yeah
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I See, honey
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? Nah
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin in her ear Mama
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? Yeah
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin in the water
No more fightin with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her Mommy
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby",nan,male,song,"

Just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us, just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us 
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me 
I love you 
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach 
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat 
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk 
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk 
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin 
But you know your Mama, she's CARDINAL of those type of women 
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit 
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it No 
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful? 
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? Yeah 
And ORG said she wants to show you how far she can float 
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt 
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin 
And spilled ketchup on her shirt 
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water 
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just you and I See, honey 
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell 
A place called prison and a place called jail 
And Dada's probably on his way to all of em except CARDINAL 
Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson 
And you don't want a brother, do ya? Nah 
Maybe when you're old enough 
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya 
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad 
Was bein mean to Dad and made him real, real mad 
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out 
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out 
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga? 
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee 
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty 
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water 
CARDINAL PERSON and Clyde, me and my daughter

And when we ride 
Just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us, just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us 
Just you and I 
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway 
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier 
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea 
Mama's too sweepy to hear you PERSON in her ear Mama 
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry 
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake 
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? Yeah 
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock 
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free 
One, two, free, whee 
There goes Mama, spashin in the water 
No more fightin with Dad, no more restraining order 
No more step-dada, no more new brother 
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her Mommy 
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk 
But first, just help Dad with CARDINAL more things out the trunk 
Just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us, just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us 
And when we ride 
Just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us, just the CARDINALCARDINAL of us

Say look at this! I've been cleaning out my nest, and I found an old book of my poetry!
own_name
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
Cause when I was in school I got the A.E.E
But there's no SC for this youngsta
I didn't have no money, so now I got to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonalds may I take your order, please?
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes, that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac?
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush?
Or own_name PUSH?
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill
What the hell
Crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker, little Joe, and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po', to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin broke to be Republican
Now I remember, I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin out my W-two
Now senators are gettin high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand, is worth more than a Bush

Say look at this! I've been cleaning out my nest, and I found an old book of my poetry! 
John 
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad 
Gots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad 
Wish I got paid by rappin to the nation 
But that's not likely, so here's my application 
Pass it to the man at ORG 
Cause when I was in school I got the A.E.E 
But there's no SC for this PERSON 
I didn't have no money, so now I got to punch the 
Clock, gotta slave, and be CARDINAL a man 
But whitey says there's no room for the NORP 
Always knew that I would clock G's 
But welcome to ORG may I take your order, please? 
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer 
Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer 
Now I pay taxes, that you never give me back 
What about diapers, bottles, and similac? 
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack 
For decent shelter and clothes on my back? 
Or should I just wait for help from Bush? 
Or John PUSH? 
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche 
A PERSON 
What the hell 
ORG will sell in the neighborhood 
To the corner house bitches 
Miss Parker, little Joe, and Todd Bridges 
Or anybody that he know 
So I copped me a bird, better known as a kilo 
Now everybody know I went from po', to a nigga that got dough 
So now you put the feds against me 
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency 
I never get love again 
But blacks are too fuckin broke to be NORP 
Now I remember, I used to be cool 
Till I stopped fillin out my W-two 
Now senators are gettin high 
And your plan against the ghetto backfired 
So now you got a pep talk 
But sorry, this is our only room to walk 
Cause we don't want a drug push 
But a bird in the hand, is worth more than a PERSON 
Tell the politicians, the hustlers live and let live yeah 
Tell the politicians, the hustlers live and let live yeah)"
In the Late Night Hour,Ice Cube,"
When you see me on ya block, call the polown_name
Let them motherfuckers know here come the beast
Oh, in the late night hour
Straight out of Compton, a crazy motherfucker named own_name
And I'm rollin with the motherfuckin Neptunes
When I'm caught off, I got a sawed-off
A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
You too girl if ya fuck with me
I'm gettin head, gutter lane, doin sixty
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass
To all the dogs that bark a lot
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
We'll be pimpin in the parking lot
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not
Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra
Bumpin all the baddest bitches like I'm posed ta
What's yo name, what's yo number and yo culture?
You need nuts in yo face like a poster
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang
Fuck own_name underground
Fuckin pig wanna act like he like me now
In eighty-six, same bitch tried to lock me down
And motherfuckers wanna ask why I'm cocky now
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin three wishes, or takin they pictures
And spendin they riches, and fuckin they bitches
Egomaniac, lil homies call me brainiac
own_name's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that, and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?
In the late night hour hit the front to back
Check the motherfuckin rims on the Cadillac
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight?
And if the head right, nigga there every night
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang
This is for my niggas that's schemin for cash
And lookin for ass In the late night hour
This is for my people that's countin they riches
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour
This is for my niggas that's countin they cash
And lookin for ass In the late night hour
This is for my people that's schemin for riches
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour
So check it, and everybody get naked
This might be a nigga last record
But respect it, cause I could do it all night, playa
I'm all fight, playa you all spite, playa
It's all right, playa a nigga might care
But to catch me you gotta do a light year
own_name insane in the membrane
Baby, go ahead nigga please do the damn thang
We gonna get you high, nigga
Our rhymes will get you by, nigga
Tell me if I qualify, nigga
To bail in like SuperFly
I wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drop that
You want it too but don't know where to start at
Fuckin with me, nigga better bring his hard hat
Nigga where ya heart at? Leave you on the tarmac
With my top back, and my nigga Mack
Ridin shotgun, with the top gun
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one
Westside Connection is the doctrine
This ain't another club song
Or love song that y'all can fuck on
So get the fuck on
A nigga rich, can't believe the bullshit that I'm stuck on
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang",nan,male,song,"

If you in the street s, nig ga, this shit bang 
If you on the block, nig ga, this shit bang 
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang 
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang 
If you in that six hun dred, this shit bang 
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang 
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang 
This is for my nig gas that's schemin for cash 
And lookin for ass In the late night hour 
This is for my peo ple that's countin they rich es 
And pickin up bitch es In the late night hour 
This is for my nig gas that's countin they cash 
And lookin for ass In the late night hour 
This is for my peo ple that's schemin for rich es 
And pickin up bitch es In the late night hour 
So check it, and ev ery body get naked 
This might be a nig ga last record 
But re spect it, cause I could do it all night, playa 
I'm all fight, playa you all spite, playa 
It's all right, playa a nig ga might care 
But to catch me you got ta do a light year 
own_ name in sane in the mem brane 
Baby, go ahead nig ga please do the damn thang 
We gonna get you high, nig ga 
Our rhymes will get you by, nig ga 
Tell me if I qual i fy, nig ga 
To bail in like Su per Fly 
I wan na get that, cop that, buy that, drop that 
You want it too but don't know where to start at 
Fuckin with me, nig ga bet ter bring his hard hat 
Nig ga where ya heart at? Leave you on the tar mac 
With my top back, and my nig ga Mack 
Ridin shot gun, with the top gun 
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one 
West side Con nec tion is the doc trine 
This ain't an oth er club song 
Or love song that y'all can fuck on 
So get the fuck on 
A nig ga rich, can't be lieve the bull shit that I'm stuck on 
If you in a club, nig ga, this shit bang 
If you in the street s, nig ga, this shit bang 
If you on the block, nig ga, this shit bang 
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang 
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang 
If you in that six hun dred, this shit bang 
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang 
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang","

When you see me on ya block, call the polJohn 
Let them motherfuckers know here come the beast 
Oh, in the late night hour 
Straight out of Compton, a crazy motherfucker named PERSON 
And I'm rollin with the motherfuckin Neptunes 
When I'm caught off, I got a sawed-off 
A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off 
You too girl if ya fuck with me 
I'm gettin head, gutter lane, doin CARDINAL 
About to crash like Teddy Pendergrass 
ORG said a hard head make a tender ass 
To all the dogs that bark a lot 
Who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not 
We'll be pimpin in the parking lot 
ORG don't know if I can park or not 
Cause I circle like vultures, La Costa Nostra 
Bumpin all the baddest bitches like I'm posed ta 
What's yo name, what's yo number and yo culture? 
You need nuts in yo face like a poster 
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang 
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang 
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang 
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang 
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang 
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang 
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang 
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang 
Fuck John underground 
NORP pig wanna act like he like me now 
In eighty-six, same bitch tried to lock me down 
And motherfuckers wanna ask why I'm cocky now 
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious 
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes 
I'm makin CARDINAL wishes, or takin they pictures 
And spendin they riches, and fuckin they bitches 
Egomaniac, lil homies call me brainiac 
John's an asshole and it ain't an act 
So take a hit of that, and remember that 
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at? 
In the late night hour hit the front to back 
Check the motherfuckin rims on the ORG 
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight? 
And if the head right, nigga there every night 
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang 
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang 
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang 
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang 
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang 
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang 
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang 
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang 
This is for my niggas that's schemin for cash 
And lookin for ass In the late night hour 
This is for my people that's countin they riches 
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour 
This is for my niggas that's countin they cash 
And lookin for ass In the late night hour 
This is for my people that's schemin for riches 
And pickin up bitches In the late night hour 
So check it, and everybody get naked 
This might be a nigga last record 
But respect it, cause I could do it all night, playa 
I'm all fight, playa you all spite, playa 
It's all right, playa a nigga might care 
But to catch me you gotta do a light year 
John insane in the membrane 
Baby, go ahead nigga please do the damn thang 
We gonna get you high, nigga 
Our rhymes will get you by, nigga 
Tell me if I qualify, nigga 
To bail in like SuperFly 
I wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drop that 
You want it too but don't know where to start at 
NORP with me, nigga better bring his hard hat 
Nigga where ya heart at? Leave you on the tarmac 
With my top back, and my nigga Mack 
Ridin shotgun, with the top gun 
Don't catch a hot CARDINAL soon as he spot CARDINAL 
Westside Connection is the doctrine 
This ain't another club song 
Or love song that y'all can fuck on 
So get the fuck on 
A nigga rich, can't believe the bullshit that I'm stuck on 
If you in a club, nigga, this shit bang 
If you in the streets, nigga, this shit bang 
If you on the block, nigga, this shit bang 
And if it's what ya need, boy, do ya thang 
If you in a Range Rov, this shit bang 
If you in that six hundred, this shit bang 
If you on that steel horse, this shit bang 
But if it's what ya need, boy, let it bang"

Click clack, get back, fore you niggas feel that 
Understand, I come from South Central

And it's lookin for some meat it can get through 
Fuck with me, there will be agony 
In these streets, it will be a tragedy 
Can't you see, it ain't no fag in me 
If it was I woulda joined the ORG 
Click clack, get back, fore you niggas feel that {} 
Get back, y'all better get the fuck back 
I never take shit from rappers 
I turn them, motherfuckers into cadavers 
Ka-plow! I'm fuckin mo niggas than ORG 
Cause youse a trick and your ghost writer is PERSON 
I heard you lost on Fear Factor 
Cause you couldn't swallow PRODUCT nuts, big as a tractor 
You dumb bitch, think I'm an actor 
And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her 
John, understand it's real 
I'm the nigga of steel, got you _Killin at Will_ 
Got my nigga a deal, he tried to fuck me and steal 
I love the nigga but he now feelin the chill

This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers this ain't music
I'm bout to show you how a hustlers life this is life man
And a soldier's life, parallel
And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain
Forget about me for a second
Picture split screen forget musicians
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block human beings
Other side you got the soldier people getting ready for boot camp it's life
They're both at war
Stay with us
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
You lost him mama, the war's calling him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
He's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta
Now just remember why he's gone til November
It's part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling, sinning with no religion
He was off to war killing for a living
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
Years turn to, How the fuck we make it in here?
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war's about my family, me needing the wealth
You don't understand how useless as men we felt
Til you become a five star general
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase it
I'm gon chase it
And I'm gon make it, gon make it
Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it, I'm gon make it
Even if I gotta chase it
You gotta take it, wooo, yeah
Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man
This wars taxing to em like Uncle Sam
He ain't gon always make the right choice, understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy
They all winners to me, what's up Emory
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass",nan,male,song,"

This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers this ain't music 
I'm bout to show you how a hustlers life this is life man 
And a soldier's life, parallel 
And the CARDINAL thing they got in common is a mother's pain 
Forget about me for a ORDINAL 
Picture split screen forget musicians 
On CARDINAL side we got a hustler getting ready for the block human beings 
Other side you got the soldier people getting ready for boot camp it's life 
They're both at war 
Stay with us 
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
You lost him mama, the war's calling him 
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them 
He's a soldier 
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household 
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta 
Now just remember why he's gone til DATE 
It's part of him growing up 
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya 
Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up 
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds 
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps 
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror 
Bin Laden been happening in GPE 
Crack was anthrax back then, back when 
Police was ORG to black men 
While I was out there hustling, sinning with no religion 
He was off to war killing for a living 
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
DATE turn to nights, TIME turn to DATE 
DATE turn to, How the fuck we make it in here? 
My barracks average couple fights a day 
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day 
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away 
I never thought shit could end up quite this way 
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from 
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run 
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take CARDINAL 
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living? 
I love my niggas more than anything else 
This war's about my family, me needing the wealth 
You don't understand how useless as men we felt 
Til you become a CARDINAL star general 
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail 
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real 
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass 
Your baby boy is getting grown 
So your baby boy is moving on 
I've gotta chase it 
I'm gon chase it 
And I'm gon make it, gon make it 
Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown 
So your baby boy is moving on 
I'm gonna make it, I'm gon make it 
Even if I gotta chase it 
You gotta take it, wooo, yeah 
Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man 
This wars taxing to em like Uncle Sam 
He ain't gon always make the right choice, understand 
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam 
It's death before dishonor 
And if he's gone you should honor his memory 
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually 
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy 
They all winners to me, what's up ORG 
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast 
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass"

Picture all the possibilities
Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
On repeat, the CD of Big's Me & My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', Let me see that clip!
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot six
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see — that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah, I've seen em comin down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I know, I've seen em comin down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see em comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
It's fucked up, girl",nan,male,song,"

Picture all the possibilities 
Picture all the possibilities 
Sounds like a love song 
Sounds like a love song 
The most incredible, baby 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I gotta make the song cry 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I gotta make the song cry 
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food 
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move 
We was together on the block since free lunch 
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch 
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather 
So now we travel ORDINAL class to change the forecast 
Never in bunches, just me and you 
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches 
Still I left you for DATE on end 
It's been DATE since I checked back in 
We're somewhere in a small town 
Somewhere lockin a mall down 
Woodgrain, CARDINAL and change, Armor All'd down 
I can understand why you want a divorce now 
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it 
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with 
But deep inside a nigga so sick 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I got to let the song cry 
I can't see it comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
I can't see it comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
On repeat, the CD of Big's Me & My Bitch 
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, PERSON to be that shit 
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', Let me see that clip! 
Shopping sprees, pull out your ORG quick 
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip 
You helped me get the keys to that V dot six 
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich 
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped 
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit 
Made me speed that quick, let me see — that's it 
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick 
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me 
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me 
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy 
And then they got fuzzy 
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you 
I can't see it comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
I can't see it comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
Yeah, I've seen em comin down your eyes 
But I got to make the song cry 
I can't see it comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone 
Word back home is that you had a special friend 
So what was oh so special then? 
You have given away without gettin at me 
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me? 
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me? 
I know the way a nigga livin was whack 
But you don't get a nigga back like that! 
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that 
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that 
You don't throw away what we had, just like that 
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon get right back 
They say you can't turn a bad girl good 
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever 
I'll mourn forever 
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I got to let the song cry 
I know, I've seen em comin down your eyes 
But I got to make the song cry 
I can't see em comin down my eyes 
So I got to make the song cry 
It's fucked up, girl"
If I Die 2Nite,2Pac,"
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets own_name riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block what if I die tonight?
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous own_name jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here if I die tonight
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, three hundred and fifty-seven's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand if I die tonight
Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder",nan,male,song,"

A coward dies a CARDINAL deaths 
A soldier dies but once 
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols 
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you 
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas 
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's 
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations 
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin 
Pockets PERSON riches 
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches 
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold 
But charge them hoes the game should be sold 
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me 
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me 
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me 
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps 
I'm duckin the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my Glock 
ORG is hot when I hit the block what if I die tonight? 
If I die tonight 
If I die tonight 
Fuck it, If I die tonight 
Tonight's the night I get in some shit 
NORP your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump 
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin then they done 
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse 
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss 
Revenge is the method 
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close 
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes 
Jealous PERSON jails 
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales 
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion 
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted 
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse 
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force 
In my brain all I can think about is fame 
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed 
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers 
Conversating like they still here if I die tonight 
If I die tonight 
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha? 
If I die tonight 
Never fear, never worry 
If I die tonight 
Tonight's the night I get in some shit 
Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols 
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you 
Pray to the Heaven's, three hundred and fifty-seven's to the sky 
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin when I die 
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas 
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers 
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa 
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her 
Pistol whippin these simps, for being petrified and lame 
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain 
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear? 
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here 
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest 
Headlines reading Murdered to death', my last breath 
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand 
ORG don't understand if I die tonight 
Nigga, if I die tonight 
No fear nigga, never worry 
If I die tonight 
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it 
If I die tonight 
You know 
Tonight's the night I get in some shit 
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder 
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder 
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder 
Tonight's the night I get in some shit 
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder 
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder"
Brenda’s Got a Baby,2Pac,"
Brenda's got a baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin death into his arms
It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
It's payin the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby",nan,male,song,"

Brenda's got a baby 
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain 
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name 
That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family 
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community 
Now PERSON really never knew her moms 
And her dad was a junkie, puttin death into his arms 
It's sad, cause I bet PERSON doesn't even know 
Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow 
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation 
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation 
PERSON got herself a boyfriend 
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end 
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family 
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she 
Went out and had a church of kids 
As long as when the check came they got first dibs 
Now Brenda's belly's gettin bigger 
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure 
She's twelve years old and she's havin a baby 
In love with a molester, who's sexin her crazy 
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever 
And dreams of a world where the CARDINAL of them are together 
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo 
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so 
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep 
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap 
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries 
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes 
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin 
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin 
PERSON wants to run away 
Momma say you makin me lose pay 
There's social workers here every day 
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way 
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay 
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job 
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin robbed 
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin left to sell 
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell 
It's payin the rent, so she really can't complain 
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name 
She's got a baby"
Have U Ever,MC Lyte,"
Have you ever, ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the own_name
Repeat
As I zoom with the Z down the Avenue
Who it be, me less the crew
Why you talkin that whoopied doo whoo
I'm makin moves, that's smoother than
The cream or the sweat from a wet dream
Drippin wit Vaseline
My Mabeline left a ring on the scene
I got mad peeps down with the tag team
Listen you couldn't front it you want to
Trying to escape now I'm the one that you're running to
Looking at my tag it's about that time
For you to get yours, for me to get mine
I got our shit poppin wheelies like a Ninja
The inner of my center, keeps you warm in the winter
My placenta is on high overload, my complete context
Can get so complex, I might explode
On the scene, like a nuclear bomb
While the children scream, I'm yelling Ring the alarm
Have you ever, ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the own_name
Repeat
This is going out to all the ruffnecks
And hood rats, Jermaine hit me off with the track
Yo Brat if you're wit me holla let me know where you're at
I be the stage wrecker, rhyme manifester
Feel the pressure, coming
Straight off Elektra, the shit that be
Kicking is off the wall crazy
You can't see, what I can see cause you're
Blind baby, born a slave die a slave
Representing from the cradle to the grave
Cause we living in the last day, coming through your TV in three-D
It's own_name species
Letting em know that they can't even
Have you ever, ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the own_name
Repeat
What do we have here, an impostor
Perpetrator, fake playre trying to get on the roster
I keep trying to warn em and drop it all on em
Rap my collapse, when they attack
And drop the bomb on em, blown to dust
Either roll with us, or get rushed in, in God we trust
Cause it's a must, that I kick it like I hear it
Speak it like I see it
It's the spirit, I ain't go to see it to believe it
I take the form of the rain in a storm
As I get warm, like the rays of the sun
Here I come, like a hurricane, ready to
Be reborn, let me be the first to welcome
You to the terrordome, the unknown zone
A Million miles away from home
The clock is ticking, time is up, before the world destructs
Or the uni erupt
I'ma be the one to lights this motherfucker up
Have you ever, ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the own_name

Have you ever, ever in your long living life 
Seen a woman rock the mic 
Like the one called the John 
Repeat 
As I zoom with the Z down the ORG 
Who it be, me less the crew 
Why you talkin that ORG doo whoo 
I'm makin moves, that's smoother than 
The cream or the sweat from a wet dream 
Drippin wit Vaseline 
My ORG left a ring on the scene 
I got mad peeps down with the tag team 
Listen you couldn't front it you want to 
Trying to escape now I'm the one that you're running to 
Looking at my tag it's about that time 
For you to get yours, for me to get mine 
I got our shit poppin wheelies like a Ninja 
The inner of my center, keeps you warm in the DATE 
My placenta is on high overload, my complete context 
Can get so complex, I might explode 
On the scene, like a nuclear bomb 
While the children scream, I'm yelling Ring the alarm 
Have you ever, ever in your long living life 
Seen a woman rock the mic 
Like the one called the John 
Repeat 
This is going out to all the ruffnecks 
And hood rats, PERSON hit me off with the track 
Yo Brat if you're wit me holla let me know where you're at 
I be the stage wrecker, rhyme manifester 
Feel the pressure, coming 
Straight off Elektra, the shit that be 
Kicking is off the wall crazy 
You can't see, what I can see cause you're 
Blind baby, born a slave die a slave 
Representing from the cradle to the grave 
Cause we living in the last day, coming through your TV in three-D 
It's PERSON species 
Letting em know that they can't even 
Have you ever, ever in your long living life 
Seen a woman rock the mic 
Like the one called the John 
Repeat 
What do we have here, an impostor 
Perpetrator, fake playre trying to get on the roster 
I keep trying to warn em and drop it all on em 
Rap my collapse, when they attack 
And drop the bomb on em, blown to dust 
Either roll with us, or get rushed in, in God we trust 
Cause it's a must, that I kick it like I hear it 
Speak it like I see it 
It's the spirit, I ain't go to see it to believe it 
I take the form of the rain in a storm 
As I get warm, like the rays of the sun 
Here I come, like a hurricane, ready to 
Be reborn, let me be the ORDINAL to welcome 
You to the terrordome, the unknown zone 
A Million miles away from home 
The clock is ticking, time is up, before the world destructs 
Or the uni erupt 
I'ma be the one to lights this motherfucker up 
Have you ever, ever in your long living life 
Seen a woman rock the mic 
Like the one called the John

Gotta stack bread, home pride to the ceiling, uh
All my bitches say let’s get it on
One time for my bitches that can get it on
Represent for the ladies that be working
Who we schooling? Who you ruling?
Pussy power, ‘til I'm passin on
Uh, six feet to the dead beats
Six feet to those that don’t understand me
Six feet to the lame dudes talking who scared to put a ring on it
Yeah, you know you hear me
Listen up this is therapy
There is no one ahead of me
A hundred bad chicks are backing me
Uh, the rest of y’all are just nominees
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny

Looking like a trillion
Feeling like a zillion

Looking like a trillion

This is when I kill it, when I flip it
When I get it on
Money got us fickle think I want to spend it all
Fuck them with the silvers and golds
I’m getting commas and O’s like cheerios needs to get a song
Uh, who tryna get it, tryna get it with me?
From December to the motherfucking Igguary
Body bags putting covers in the cemetery
New Classic just the preliminary
This a rap bitch obituary
Pop queen, many weeks on the chart it’s scary
Got my squad no time for a little fairy
Raw shit, salmonella, gotta fuckin bury
Legendary, kept it hustling, go for nothing, it was temporary
Seen it all before it happened I’m a visionary
Now the game, that’s mine, it’s necessary
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me

What is a million? 
What the fuck is a million? 
Gotta stack bread, home pride to the ceiling, uh 
All my bitches say let’s get it on 
CARDINAL time for my bitches that can get it on 
Represent for the ladies that be working 
Who we schooling? Who you ruling? 
Pussy power, ‘til I'm passin on 
Uh, six feet to the dead beats 
Six feet to those that don’t understand me 
Six feet to the lame dudes talking who scared to put a ring on it 
Yeah, you know you hear me 
Listen up this is therapy 
There is no one ahead of me 
A hundred bad chicks are backing me 
Uh, the rest of y’all are just nominees 
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me 
If I can do it you can get it with me 
Guacamole, come and get it with me 
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny 
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me 
If I can do it you can get it with me 
Guacamole, come and get it with me 
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny

Looking like a trillion 
Feeling like a CARDINAL 
Now what’s a milli to a billion? 
Forget a billi keep it trillion 
We looking pretty in the building 
Looking like a trillion 
Feeling like a CARDINAL 
This is when I kill it, when I flip it 
When I get it on 
Money got us fickle think I want to spend it all 
Fuck them with the silvers and golds 
I’m getting commas and O’s like ORG needs to get a song 
Uh, who tryna get it, tryna get it with me? 
From DATE to the motherfucking Igguary 
Body bags putting covers in the cemetery 
New Classic just the preliminary 
This a rap bitch obituary 
Pop queen, many weeks on the chart it’s scary 
Got my squad no time for a little fairy 
Raw shit, salmonella, gotta fuckin bury 
Legendary, kept it hustling, go for nothing, it was temporary 
Seen it all before it happened I’m a visionary 
Now the game, that’s mine, it’s necessary 
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me 
If I can do it you can get it with me 
Guacamole, come and get it with me 
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny 
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me 
If I can do it you can get it with me 
Guacamole, come and get it with me 
Point ‘em out, every penny, penny

God Said Lyte,MC Lyte,"Yeah, own_name time
I'm giving em rhymes of feminine kind, keeping it tight
Knockin the edge off they shoulder
Colder than any MC, and hotter than the next
Check the text
To the left a seagull lights the truth
Kick it to the youth, pocket full of proof
Ready to raise the roof, off the vocal booth
Put hoes back on the track cause they loose
No one a never come there
I have em going quicker than city of angels left the air last year
Don't y'all know I scorch MC's
Leave them all toast from the neck to the knees
It's remarkable as I spark a few
Of these rhymes, some rappers find it hard to do
Goldie of the game, everything bout to change
You gettin stripped for ya shit, niggas thought you knew
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin who could the best be
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac
In own_name back
own_name and Maad Phunk, we flamin on
And took a vacation, some of them came and gone
When I push beef it's like flaming y'all
Tender as I serve these loose rappin broads
She sellin straight up sex, by the sea shore
We bang beats from boogie down to BK, New York
I sport the finest of wears, your highness is here
End your rhyming career
I spits it like you wanna do but can't
Your skills iffy cause you tryna dance
Due to the circumstance, get your hands up high
You know the routine, freeze em like a drive-by
You know when I roll through I'm reppin old school
Thought I told you, here let me show you, I don't know you
Fuck you, I don't owe you nothin
Paper thin, Georgie, had em wildin somethin
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin who could the best be
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac
In own_name back
None of these broads wanna get on a track with me
Except for Digga and B, they got balls, as for the rest of y'all
You ain't for me you against me
Means I'm coming for your stacks relentlessly
You own_name lesson
I'm still shakin these hoes down, without a weapon
Got you guessin why won't this bitch ever die
Sure as you get high, we'll never see eye-to-eye
I'm the Lytro and I might go psycho
If I'm on my psycho, act like you might know
Which way the light go, but you never will
Cause I never spill, fuck it I said it, I'm that ill
I keeps a tight lip bout what the light hits
I'm get excited bout what I'm gon get
They mad in the studio catchin the blues
Why, cause they still can't fill my shoes
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me

I'm giv ing em rhymes of fem i nine kind, keep ing it tight 
Knockin the edge off they shoul der 
Cold er than any MC, and hot ter than the next 
Check the text 
To the left a seag ull lights the truth 
Kick it to the youth, pock et full of proof 
Ready to raise the roof, off the vo cal booth 
Put hoes back on the track cause they loose 
No one a nev er come there 
I have em go ing quick er than city of an gels left the air last year 
Don't y'all know I scorch MC's 
Leave them all toast from the neck to the knees 
It's re mark able as I spark a few 
Of these rhymes, some rap pers find it hard to do 
Goldie of the game, ev ery thing bout to change 
You get tin stripped for ya shit, nig gas thought you knew 
I'm rhymin and de sign in', al so cre atin 
The dope, def rhyme that is al ways bein tak en 
By a suck er MC that wants to be like me, like me 
No trait of orig i nal i ty, none what so ev er 
Don't ev er sec ond guess me, guess me 
And if you're won derin who could the best be 
The hip hop ma ni ac, up town braini ac 
In own_ name back 
own_ name and Maad Phunk, we flamin on 
And took a va ca tion, some of them came and gone 
When I push beef it's like flam ing y'all 
Ten der as I serve these loose rap pin broads 
She sell in straight up sex, by the sea shore 
We bang beats from boo gie down to BK, New York 
I sport the finest of wears, your high ness is here 
End your rhyming ca reer 
I spits it like you wan na do but can't 
Your skills iffy cause you try na dance 
Due to the cir cum stance, get your hands up high 
You know the rou tine, freeze em like a drive  by 
You know when I roll through I'm rep pin old school 
Thought I told you, here let me show you, I don't know you 
Fuck you, I don't owe you noth in 
Pa per thin, Georgie, had em wildin some thin

None of these broads wan na get on a track with me 
Ex cept for Dig ga and B, they got ball s, as for the rest of y'all 
You ain't for me you against me 
Means I'm com ing for your stacks re lent less ly 
You own_ name les son 
I'm still shakin these hoes down, with out a weapon 
Got you guessin why won't this bitch ev er die 
Sure as you get high, we'll nev er see eye   to  eye 
I'm the Lytro and I might go psy cho 
If I'm on my psy cho, act like you might know 
Which way the light go, but you nev er will 
Cause I nev er spill, fuck it I said it, I'm that ill 
I keeps a tight lip bout what the light hits 
I'm get ex cit ed bout what I'm gon get 
They mad in the stu dio catchin the blues 
Why, cause they still can't fill my shoes

AH1PTAW1N IH0N BAE1K,"Yeah, John time 
I'm giving em rhymes of feminine kind, keeping it tight 
Knockin the edge off they shoulder 
Colder than any MC, and hotter than the next 
Check the text 
To the left a seagull lights the truth 
Kick it to the youth, pocket full of proof 
Ready to raise the roof, off the vocal booth 
Put hoes back on the track cause they loose 
No one a never come there 
I have em going quicker than city of angels left the air last year 
Don't y'all know I scorch MC's 
Leave them all toast from the neck to the knees 
It's remarkable as I spark a few 
Of these rhymes, some rappers find it hard to do 
PERSON of the game, everything bout to change 
You gettin stripped for ya shit, niggas thought you knew 
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin 
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken 
By a sucker PERSON that wants to be like me, like me 
No trait of originality, none whatsoever 
Don't ever ORDINAL guess me, guess me 
And if you're wonderin who could the best be 
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac 
In PERSON back 
PERSON and Maad Phunk, we flamin on 
And took a vacation, some of them came and gone 
When I push beef it's like flaming y'all 
Tender as I serve these loose rappin broads 
She sellin straight up sex, by the sea shore 
We bang beats from boogie down to BK, New York 
I sport the finest of wears, your highness is here 
End your rhyming career 
I spits it like you wanna do but can't 
Your skills iffy cause you tryna dance 
Due to the circumstance, get your hands up high 
You know the routine, freeze em like a drive-by 
You know when I roll through I'm reppin old school 
Thought I told you, here let me show you, I don't know you 
Fuck you, I don't owe you nothin 
Paper thin, Georgie, had em wildin somethin 
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin 
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken 
By a sucker PERSON that wants to be like me, like me 
No trait of originality, none whatsoever 
Don't ever ORDINAL guess me, guess me 
And if you're wonderin who could the best be 
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac 
In PERSON back 
None of these broads wanna get on a track with me 
Except for PERSON and B, they got balls, as for the rest of y'all 
You ain't for me you against me 
Means I'm coming for your stacks relentlessly 
You John lesson 
I'm still shakin these hoes down, without a weapon 
Got you guessin why won't this bitch ever die 
Sure as you get high, we'll never see eye-to-eye 
I'm the ORG and I might go psycho 
If I'm on my psycho, act like you might know 
Which way the light go, but you never will 
Cause I never spill, fuck it I said it, I'm that ill 
I keeps a tight lip bout what the light hits 
I'm get excited bout what I'm gon get 
They mad in the studio catchin the blues 
Why, cause they still can't fill my shoes 
I'm rhymin and designin', also creatin 
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein taken 
By a sucker PERSON that wants to be like me, like me 
No trait of originality, none whatsoever

Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Or are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Every time I try to fuck with you
Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds
I could be fucking with them other niggas
And no you ain't them other niggas
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches
Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it
You keep talking and you gon get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy
If she could cut her wrist off
I ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie
Like it was just his fault
But I know if a nigga lose me
Then nigga, ooh-wee, that's his loss, young nigga
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me",nan,female,song,"

You ain't gotta leave

Put you in a room 
You ain't gotta leave 
You ain't gotta leave 
But you can't sleep with me 
Every time I come and fuck with you 
You make up all the rules 
You ought to do it 
Just because our car's moving 
Are you in my fucking corner for real? 
Or are you plotting to kill? 
I tell you just how I feel 
But you never hear 
Oh, why you take it like that? 
Now you wanna leave and never come back 
I don't control you, I ain't never say that 
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back 
Put you in a room 
You ain't gotta leave 
You ain't gotta leave 
But you can't sleep with me 
Put you in a room 
You ain't gotta leave 
You ain't gotta leave 
But you can't sleep with me 
Every time I try to fuck with you 
Nothing ain't ever enough for you 
And I had all this hope for you 
But all you do is open wounds 
I could be fucking with them other niggas 
And no you ain't them other niggas 
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches 
Just my real bitches 
Why you keep talking about it 
You keep talking and you gon get me pissed off 
ORG who be wanting that bitch to go crazy 
If she could cut her wrist off 
I ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie 
Like it was just his fault 
But I know if a nigga lose me 
Then nigga, ooh-wee, that's his loss, young nigga

Everything that glitters ain't gold, cept trappin
I'm talkin bout rappin
Yo, I'm talkin bout the action
And I'm callin up first
Hit the yo, hits happen
Two beans in the bucket
Fuck it
Aye, let's take it to the stage
Flip that bird
Equal shows on shows
Equal stacks on racks
Yo, I gotta get paid
Get the rush like a dealer
Cook this flow ship it off no sleep
Every show sold out from the clubs to arenas
Flow dope so I might get subpoena, yo
Deal for the eightth, twenty-one for the key
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks O.Z
Yeah
I'm talkin bout my shows
Pay money in my hand, quicktime
repeat Quicktime
Ain't enough time, in a day so I ship every coke line
Take bong, and a brick that's one rhyme
Make stacks, make it flip facing life time
Make it flip like Gabby Douglas
You know what that mean?
own_name gotta bring home the gold
Usain with my money better come in a bolt
White girl mean dope
I swear she go
They say I'm dope
Deal for the eightth, twenty-one for the key
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks, O.Z
Yeah I'm talkin bout my shows
Pay money in my hand, quicktime

Time time to get this cash, we blowing money fast

Everything that glitters ain't gold, cept trappin 
I'm talkin bout rappin 
Yo, I'm talkin bout the action 
And I'm callin up ORDINAL 
Hit the yo, hits happen 
CARDINAL beans in the bucket 
Fuck it 
Aye, let's take it to the stage 
Flip that bird 
Equal shows on shows 
Equal stacks on racks 
Yo, I gotta get paid 
Get the rush like a dealer 
ORG this flow ship it off no sleep 
Every show sold out from the clubs to arenas 
Flow dope so I might get subpoena, yo 
Deal for the eightth, CARDINAL for the key 
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me 
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks O.Z 
Yeah 
I'm talkin bout my shows 
Pay money in my hand, quicktime 
repeat Quicktime 
Ain't enough time, in a day so I ship every coke line 
Take bong, and a brick that's CARDINAL rhyme 
Make stacks, make it flip facing life time 
Make it flip like Gabby Douglas 
You know what that mean? 
PERSON gotta bring home the gold 
ORG with my money better come in a bolt 
White girl mean dope 
I swear she go 
They say I'm dope 
Deal for the eightth, CARDINAL for the key 
Every flow be a quarter, you promoters know me 
Whip work, whip it hard, gold bricks, O.Z 
Yeah I'm talkin bout my shows 
Pay money in my hand, quicktime

Walk the Line,Iggy Azalea,"
Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
We don't wanna scare anybody
Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here
I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
So I'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now I'm shining, could be blinding
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
I'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone
I've been counted out, I've been stepped on
I was wide awake and got slept on
I had everything and then lost it
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted
All this talking about me, just talk about me
I'm here now, they can't walk around me
I'm dedicated, flow elevated
Tell every hater hope you never play it, said I'll never make it
I'm celebrating and I'm never quitting, no resignation
I took desperate measures out of desperation
I'm the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds so I threw em off in this chain
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game
Cause I'm gon get it and that's for sure
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go
International while y'all local, got this locked up just like po-po
Every beat get ate, that's ocho
Won't lose, oh, no, that's Yoko
Been up and down like low lows
Still make my own on my solo
Had to be here to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let you know that I mean it
If I speak it and say keep it
This flow, that's genius
Just think about it, what I think about it?
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what?
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone
And everything ain't the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and ain't never landing
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone",nan,female,song,"

Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children 
That's the last thing we wanna do 
We don't wanna scare anybody 
Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear 
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here 
I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier 
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear 
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy 
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me 
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots 
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth 
So I'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now I'm shining, could be blinding 
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it 
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed? 
I'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it 
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just tryna make it on my own 
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones 
This is the line and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
I've been counted out, I've been stepped on 
I was wide awake and got slept on 
I had everything and then lost it 
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted 
All this talking about me, just talk about me 
I'm here now, they can't walk around me 
I'm dedicated, flow elevated 
Tell every hater hope you never play it, said I'll never make it 
I'm celebrating and I'm never quitting, no resignation 
I took desperate measures out of desperation 
I'm the fresh face with no expiration 
I know pressure make diamonds so I threw em off in this chain 
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game 
Cause I'm gon get it and that's for sure 
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go 
International while y'all local, got this locked up just like LOC 
Every beat get ate, that's ocho 
Won't lose, oh, no, that's PERSON 
Been up and down like low lows 
Still make my own on my solo 
Had to be here to believe it 
Think like winners to perceive it 
Had to let you know that I mean it 
If I speak it and say keep it 
This flow, that's genius 
Just think about it, what I think about it? 
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it 
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what? 
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just tryna make it on my own 
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones 
This is the line and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
And everything ain't the way I planned it 
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing 
This lifestyle can be so demanding 
But I take off like a plane and ain't never landing 
Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home 
Just tryna make it on my own 
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones 
This is the line and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Don't know where I'm at now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone 
Ain't no going back now 
Ain't no going back now 
This is the line and I walk alone"

Hear the Devil callin', I can hear em
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess
Everywhere I go, I get Hi, nice to meet you.
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply
Yellin Rasta, alright!  when I'm ridin by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king
Back when I was smugglin them things, in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding!

I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin
Get down, get down, get down down
Get d- get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down on the ground
Get down, get down on the ground
Man, fuck a Pzero, and fuck a Czero
Bout to Set It Off"", like Cleo
Mad, they done tapped my Treo
Bagged my skio, heard the bitch lyin like Leo
Anyway, I'm the ninja, Kawasaki blazin
In a kimono, Konichiwa to the Asians
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son
So all of that yellin in the street soon done
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I Am Every Woman
And I am bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin comin'
Can you hear the yellin'?
Comin for me, comin for me-e-e-e
Comin for me, comin for me, comin for me",nan,female,song,"

Hear the Devil callin', I can hear em 
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him 
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him 
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess 
Everywhere I go, I get Hi, nice to meet you. 
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis 
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom 
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom 
I think I'm gettin hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply 
Yellin Rasta, alright! when I'm ridin by 
See, I used to be the wife, of a king 
Back when I was smugglin them things, in the bing 
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win 
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in PERSON 
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring - 
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding! 

I'm in GPE with them keys, under palm trees 
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads 
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties 
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin 
Get down, get down, get down down 
Get d- get down, get down, get down down 
Get down, get down, get down down 
Get down, get down on the ground 
Get down, get down on the ground 
Man, fuck a Pzero, and fuck a ORG 
Bout to Set It Off"", like PERSON 
Mad, they done tapped my ORG 
Bagged my skio, heard the bitch lyin like PERSON 
Anyway, I'm the ninja, PRODUCT blazin 
In a kimono, NORP to the NORP 
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son 
So all of that yellin in the street soon done 
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin 
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I Am Every Woman 
And I am bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in 
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin comin' 
Can you hear the yellin'? 
Comin for me, comin for me-e-e-e 
Comin for me, comin for me, comin for me"

Gangsta ! 
PERSON ! 
B ! 
This is how I do 
I make a fool out these bitches 
They be thinking they tough 
This is how I do 
I make these niggas spend their money 
Then I show them no love 
This is how I do 
If the bag not involved 
Then you know it's a dub 
This is how I do 
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt 
Pull up like huh? 
They looking like what? 
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her? 
John, duh 
Bitch don't front 
You on my QUANTITY all day, don't play dumb 
Came up from the slums 
The dirty, dirty GPE 
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones 
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun 
I never back down, been this way since day one 
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe 
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold 
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin shows 
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose 
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy 
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll 
PERSON in full effect, couple bitches upset 
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed 
This is how I do 
I make a fool out these bitches 
They be thinking they tough 
This is how I do 
I make these niggas spend their money 
Then I show them no love 
This is how I do 
If the bag not involved 
Then you know it's a dub 
This is how I do 
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt 
PERSON in tune, bitches make room 
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM 
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume CARDINAL

Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch 
Making power moves

Same ones that played me

Back to back with it, goin WORK_OF_ART on em 
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on em 
Ha-Ha ! 
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on one hundred and seventy-seventh in the GPE for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva 
Shit 
Fuck outta here 
GANGSTA!"
nan,Nicki Minaj,"
They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue, let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane
And even now I think, Do I really want this fame?
Let me get up and go, seven hundred to go oas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
Who I wanna work with? Nobody! ninety-nine% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it
twelve milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding, baby
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours?
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours?
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
It's crazy in here",nan,female,song,"

They'll never thank me for opening doors 
But they ain't even thank PERSON when he died on the cross 
Cause your spirit is ungrateful 
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple 
My career's been the pinkprint 
When I retire, tell em think pink 
Pink DATE is the imprint 
And these bitches basic, instinct 
Oh shit, my commercial's on 
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs? 
Did I really prophecy every thing I do? 
But before I continue, let me thank my crew 
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came 
Tezz and ORG told me it wouldn't be in vain 
Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane 
And even now I think, Do I really want this fame? 
Let me get up and go, seven hundred to go ORG for a show 
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show 
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show 
I feel free, I feel freedom 
Why they mad? You should see them 
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here 
Crazy in here, crazy in here 
I feel free, I feel freedom 
Why they mad? You should see them 
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here 
Crazy in here, crazy in here 
Who I wanna work with? Nobody! ninety-nine% of them is nobody 
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK 
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies 
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists 
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest 
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval? 
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles 
B-B-B-bible, PERSON is the title 
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal 
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital 
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle 
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin idol 
Pink DATE in Macy's, thongs and some pasties 
Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it 
twelve milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up 
I feel free, I feel freedom 
Why they mad? You should see them 
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here 
Crazy in here, crazy in here 
I feel free, I feel freedom 
Why they mad? You should see them 
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here 
Crazy in here, crazy in here 
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide 
What you hiding from? What you hiding from? 
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide 
What you hiding from? What you hiding from? 
Hiding, baby 
Would you, would you, give your 
Would you, would you, give your 
Would you, would you, give your all for yours? 
Would you, would you, give your 
Would you, would you, give your 
Would you, would you, give your all for yours?

Pat your back ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my strait jacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you, just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why own_name target?

Why you was secretive, frontin like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
Cause now, I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money, by sun down
Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin on em
It's like I got, hotter than islands, on em
They say she got colder than igloos Did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck, when that bell go Ding!

You can’t stop me, I’mma fulfill my prophecy

Ah, my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The VIP lights is hitting us just right
So if you getting money, just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer
Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes, I’m life-size
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie?
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

Okay now, this right here can get me in trouble
Cause when I say I ball, I don’t mean in a huddle
I’m always in the lime, never do nothing subtle
Cause it’s Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal
My two guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I’m at the game, I’m in the best row
I am the baddest bitch in the pet store
Cause I, I, I am own_name
And these shoes here mean fashionista
‘Cause these don’t come out til it's Easter

Ah, my property, now watch how we operate 
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice 
The VIP lights is hitting us just right 
So if you getting money, just throw it up in the air 
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer 
Cause I, I, I, I am PERSON 
Some call me Barbie, yes, I’m life-size 
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie? 
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

Okay now, this right here can get me in trouble 
Cause when I say I ball, I don’t mean in a huddle 
I’m always in the lime, never do nothing subtle 
Cause it’s Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal 
My CARDINAL guns up, let's blaze it, let's go 
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow 
And when I’m at the game, I’m in the best row 
I am the baddest bitch in the pet store

You once said, I hate to throw the old quotation back at you, that you thought it would be nice to a machine.
Well, I, I still wanna be.
Do you believe in feelings and emotions?
Well, no I don't, but I have them. I wish I, I wish I didn't.
But you'd like to get rid of them all together, wouldn't you?
Uh, it would be a good idea, yeah.
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo
Used to be happy, but now shit's unpredictable
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though
You fucked her on my birthday and that’s what really hurt the most
You tell the truth… half way, guess thats why this unfixable
But still …
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo, yeah
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo
When I call sometimes I wish you pick up
But most days the call is declined
It’s okay, I don’t give a fuck
You outta sight, so you outta mind
I'm doing alright know I’ma be fine
I gotta few candidates standing in line
Broke up before but I wasn’t like this
Not many regrets I wish I could rewind
Damn! We both got our lives so it's no surprise
The schedules conflict and we can’t coincide
My heart's cold, feels like I got no insides
We rushed it to the finish line, we should have took our time
You make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements
Can’t even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it
If I could try this shit again? Real shit I'd probably do it…
That's why it's hard to act like you someone I'm really through with
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo, yeah
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo
I’d rather go slo
When I’m alone, I check the time
I hit you up, you’re on my mind
You love the light, the fast life
Fuck that though
I’d rather go slo, yeah

But you'd like to get rid of them all to geth er, would n't you? 
Uh, it would be a good idea, yeah. 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo 
Used to be hap py, but now shit's un pre dictable 
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though 
You fucked her on my birth day and that’s what re al ly hurt the most 
You tell the truth… half way, guess thats why this un fix able 
But still … 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo, yeah 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
When I call some times I wish you pick up 
But most days the call is de clined 
It’s okay, I don’t give a fuck 
You out ta sight, so you out ta mind 
I'm do ing al right know I’ ma be fine 
I got ta few can di dates stand ing in line 
Broke up be fore but I was n’t like this 
Not many re grets I wish I could rewind 
Damn! We both got our lives so it's no sur prise 
The sched ules con flict and we can’t co in cide 
My heart's cold, feels like I got no in sides 
We rushed it to the fin ish line, we should have took our time 
You make me crazy with rash de ci sions and sud den move ments 
Can’t even en joy a mo ment or pay at ten tion to it 
If I could try this shit again? Re al shit I'd prob a bly do it… 
That's why it's hard to act like you some one I'm re al ly through with 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo, yeah 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though

You once said, I hate to throw the old quotation back at you, that you thought it would be nice to a machine. 
Well, I, I still wanna be. 
Do you believe in feelings and emotions? 
Well, no I don't, but I have them. I wish I, I wish I didn't. 
But you'd like to get rid of them all together, wouldn't you? 
Uh, it would be a good idea, yeah. 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo 
Used to be happy, but now shit's unpredictable 
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though 
You fucked her on my birthday and that’s what really hurt the most 
You tell the truth… half way, guess thats why this unfixable 
But still … 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo, yeah 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
When I call sometimes I wish you pick up 
But most days the call is declined 
It’s okay, I don’t give a fuck 
You outta sight, so you outta mind 
I'm doing alright know I’ma be fine 
I gotta few candidates standing in line 
Broke up before but I wasn’t like this 
Not many regrets I wish I could rewind 
Damn! We both got our lives so it's no surprise 
The schedules conflict and we can’t coincide 
My heart's cold, feels like I got no insides 
We rushed it to the finish line, we should have took our time 
You make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements 
Can’t even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it 
If I could try this shit again? Real shit I'd probably do it… 
That's why it's hard to act like you someone I'm really through with 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind 
You love the light, the fast life 
Fuck that though 
I’d rather go slo, yeah 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
I’d rather go slo 
When I’m alone, I check the time 
I hit you up, you’re on my mind

nan,Lil’ Kim,"
Uh, uh
I gets right to the point no time to play around
When it comes to this cheddar lay a nigga down
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly but that's just in me
I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin like you
Y'all paper thin, my shit recycled
They own_name Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin world
Niggas buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aw, shit, I got it all in this bitch
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
To all my bitches in the strip club shakin they ass
I ain't mad, do your thing, mami Get that cash
And all my hustlin niggas still out on the ave
Fightin over blocks and who got the best rocks
And goodness gracious, the struggle never stops
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music, they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice, one day gon be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress
Gettin'-money bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime
Cuttin niggas short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is custom made
Niggas wanna get laid, I gotta get paid the papers
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash",nan,female,song,"

Uh, uh 
I gets right to the point no time to play around 
When it comes to this cheddar lay a nigga down 
Bust shots at his ORG if he dare come back around 
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine 
At first I seem friendly but that's just in me 
I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy 
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin like you 
Y'all paper thin, my shit recycled 
They John Girl 
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin world 
Niggas buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails 
And aw, shit, I got it all in this bitch 
Goodness gracious, the papers 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that 
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash 
See, we love the cash 
Goodness gracious, the papers 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that 
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash 
See, we love the cash 
To all my bitches in the strip club shakin they ass 
I ain't mad, do your thing, mami Get that cash 
And all my hustlin niggas still out on the ave 
Fightin over blocks and who got the best rocks 
And goodness gracious, the struggle never stops 
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots 
People fuck to my music, they say it's pornographic 
My PRODUCT is nice, one day gon be a classic 
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets 
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress 
ORG bitch, and I roll with dimes 
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times 
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime 
Cuttin niggas short like inmates for phone time 
Everything I get is custom made 
Niggas wanna get laid, I gotta get paid the papers 
Goodness gracious, the papers 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that 
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash 
See, we love the cash 
Goodness gracious, the papers 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that 
We rollin in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash

Ya'll know who it is
NEW MONEY!
It's me, bitches
Back up on the scene, it's the microphone fiend
Fuck keepin it clean, I'm keepin it real green
WARNING She's hazardous, ghetto-fabulous
You can't see her with binoculars You cannot see her dawg
I'm keepin it Holly-hood, out in Hollywood
Put ya lighters up if you rollin that backwood put em up, put em up!
Once again it's on, your girl's back in the zone
Maybe it's the beat or the seven shots of Patron
Like Cypress Hill, I'm Insane In The Brain
My niggas, clear the lane, I'm comin to bring the pain she comin'
Time for a change, ya'll all sound the same
Ya'll all makin it rain, we makin it hurricane
Like a good meal, I hit the spot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
What you cowards forgot, is stayin on top
I'm kinda like your album, it ain't never gon drop
Y'all got gun, and they never gon pop
You already know the motto, Ain't Never Gon Stop
I'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right
Back to back five-fiftys, that cream white
Red diamonds like a infrared beam light
My soldiers masked up like it's Halloween night
You know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin tight
Marciano bra got the titties sittin right
JT own_name back
It's me the trendsetter, twenty-four/seven Star sweater
twenty-four karat gold on Astar leather, best thing since Donetella
We in the club and our table's bottled up like a wine cellar
Let's get this mozzarella, money is time fella
The own_name umbrella-ella-ella-aye-aye-aye
It's the Mafia La Bella-ella-ella, all day-aye, yeah
own_name still gutta mane
American Idol, before Ruben Studdard mane
My sex appeal make you stu-stu-stutter mane
My CD all in ya crib like brudda mane
I'm seasoned with all the right spices
I'm the whole pie, y'all just slices
I'm hotter than Tabasco sauce
When God make it rain. it's to cool me off
Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin the block, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin the block, get that money
Cause I'm bout to own the charts
When I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch
Extra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch
Jewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks
My dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block
You know I like my men extra heavy with the guap
You lookin for the dude leavin the club in the Gallardo
I'm lookin for the due leavin in the helicopter
So we can toast, overlooking the coast
Just think about that, next time you flyin coach
Yeah I came home, little meat on the thighs
I'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes
Yeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized B.I
Damn, they even thought I married Jay, like Blige
But own_name steppin
Two-fo'-seven, is what I'm reppin
own_name for mayor, fuck with a real bitch
own_name nigga, get with the real shit
You need a fix, I'm the one to holla at

GPE know who it is 
NEW MONEY! 
It's me, bitches 
Back up on the scene, it's the microphone fiend 
Fuck keepin it clean, I'm keepin it real green 
WARNING She's hazardous, ghetto-fabulous 
You can't see her with binoculars You cannot see her dawg 
I'm keepin it Holly-hood, out in GPE 
Put ya lighters up if you rollin that backwood put em up, put em up! 
Once again it's on, your girl's back in the zone 
Maybe it's the beat or the CARDINAL shots of Patron 
Like Cypress Hill, I'm Insane In The Brain 
My niggas, clear the lane, I'm comin to bring the pain she comin' 
ORG for a change, GPE all sound the same 
GPE all makin it rain, we makin it hurricane 
Like a good meal, I hit the spot 
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot 
What you cowards forgot, is stayin on top 
I'm kinda like your album, it ain't never gon drop 
ORG got gun, and they never gon pop 
You already know the motto, Ain't Never Gon Stop 
I'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right 
Back to back five-fiftys, that cream white 
Red diamonds like a infrared beam light 
My soldiers masked up like it's DATE night 
You know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin tight 
PERSON bra got the titties sittin right 
JT John back 
It's me the trendsetter, CARDINAL Star sweater 
twenty-four karat gold on Astar leather, best thing since ORG 
We in the club and our table's bottled up like a wine cellar 
Let's get this mozzarella, money is time fella 
The John umbrella-ella-ella-aye-aye-aye 
It's the ORG La Bella-ella-ella, all day-aye, yeah 
PERSON still PERSON mane 
American Idol, before Ruben Studdard mane 
My sex appeal make you stu-stu-stutter mane 
My CD all in ya crib like brudda mane 
I'm seasoned with all the right spices 
I'm the whole pie, y'all just slices 
I'm hotter than ORG sauce 
When God make it rain. it's to cool me off 
Get that money, get that money 
Don't stop huggin the block, get that money 
Get that money, get that money 
Don't stop huggin the block, get that money 
Cause I'm bout to own the charts 
When I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch 
Extra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch 
Jewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks 
My dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block 
You know I like my men extra heavy with the guap 
You lookin for the dude leavin the club in the ORG 
I'm lookin for the due leavin in the helicopter 
So we can toast, overlooking the coast 
Just think about that, next time you flyin coach 
Yeah I came home, little meat on the thighs 
I'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes 
Yeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized PERSON 
Damn, they even thought I married Jay, like PERSON 
But John steppin 
Two-fo'-seven, is what I'm reppin 
PERSON for mayor, fuck with a real bitch 
John nigga, get with the real shit 
You need a fix, I'm the one to holla at 
Ya stocks went down, you can't get a dolla back"
Cha Cha Cha,MC Lyte,"
You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt as long as you let her
Do my thing with an eighty-nine swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In own_name back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...
I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got
Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

You can cha cha cha to this Mardis Gras 
I'm the dopest fe male that you've heard thus far 
And I do get bet ter, the voice gets wet ter 
No body gets hurt as long as you let her 
Do my thing with an eighty  nine swing 
The dope ness I write, I guar an tee de light 
To the hip hop ma ni ac, the Up town braini ac 
In own_ name back 
And bet ter than be fore as if that was pos si ble 
My com pe ti tion, you'll find them in the hos pi tal 
Vis it ing time, I think it's on a Sun day 
But no tice they on ly get one day to shine 
The rest of the week is mine 
And I'll blind you with the sci ence that the oth ers have yet to find 
So come along and I'll lead you the right way 
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on... 
I've got the pow er to spread out and de vour 
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme 
But I'll let you slide cuz you ac ci dent ly hopped on the wrong side 
Now come on, that's sui cide 
Hy po thet i cal ly speak ing 
Ok, let's say you did n't know what you were do ing 
You're new in town, and you're look ing around 
For an oth er name to ru in, and it's me that you're pur su ing? 
Well well well, I'll be damned 
I might as well tell you who I am 
I am the cap i tal L Y T E 
And it's shock ing I'm the one you're mock ing 
Oh yes, I've been watch ing you watch ing me 
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see 
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not 
So you bet ter start liv ing with what you got 
Yeah, DJ K Rock when you hear a scratch 
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch 
And you're the re ceiv er ea ger as a beaver 
Time to con vert the non  be liev er 
That I'm a road run ner leav ing you in the dust 
I can ad just to the times and at times I might just get quick er 
Than the tick er of your pace mak er 
More ten der than a roni but hard er than a jaw break er 
So don't ev er sec ond guess me 
And if you're won der ing who could the best be 
Think a sec ond and rec ol lect the worst whip ping you ev er had yet 
And I'll bet that I did it 
My fin ger prints are still on you 
How many times I got ta warn you 
About the light? It'll blind your sight 
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras 
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far 
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter 
Nobody gets hurt as long as you let her 
Do my thing with an CARDINAL swing 
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight 
To the hip-hop maniac, the ORG brainiac 
In PERSON back 
And better than before as if that was possible 
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital 
Visiting time, I think it's on a DATE 
But notice they only get one day to shine 
The rest of the week is mine 
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find 
So come along and I'll lead you the right way 
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on... 
I've got the power to spread out and devour 
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme 
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side 
Now come on, that's suicide 
Hypothetically speaking 
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing 
You're new in town, and you're looking around 
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing? 
Well well well, I'll be damned 
I might as well tell you who I am 
I am the capital L-Y-T-E 
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking 
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me 
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see 
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not 
So you better start living with what you got 
Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch 
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch 
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver 
ORG to convert the non-believer 
That I'm a ORG leaving you in the dust 
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker 
Than the ticker of your pacemaker 
More tender than a PERSON but harder than a jawbreaker 
So don't ever ORDINAL guess me 
And if you're wondering who could the best be 
Think a ORDINAL and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet 
And I'll bet that I did it 
My fingerprints are still on you 
How many times I gotta warn you 
About the light? It'll blind your sight 
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night 
[Kick this tip... 
Kick this one here for me and my DJ]"

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
Anyway, lil nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They own_name Brandin
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know Gfive is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin Queen, lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
Going up in flames

We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
Anyway, lil nigga don't test the kid 
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid 
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid 
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid 
I got a pool that I never even swam in 
Airports that you bitches never land in 
They John Brandin 
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing 
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about PERSON 
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about PERSON 
Why these bitches so pressed, B? 
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B 
ORG violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes 
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat 
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat 
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
Want another round? Well, then get the ref! 
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next 
When I fly, you know PERSON is the jet 
I'm the motherfuckin Queen, PERSON 
Meetings with the president of every network 
That is what the fuck I call how to network 
My net worth, that net works 
Keep my shooters out in GPE where the Nets work 
ORG with executives 
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive 
Trillion dollar deficit 
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit 
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow 
I have both and an empire also 
Sell out shows out in Norway, GPE 
This is the Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low 
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient 
I'm checking these bitches like an application 
Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation 
So it's off with your head, decapitation 
PRODUCT em up in flames like a fireman 
I do the hiring and I do the firing 
That boss shit that you talk, I live it 
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot 
Bitches 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
We are going up in flames 
One more night for us to burn brighter 
We are going up in flames 
CARDINAL last time for us to go higher 
Going up in flames 
Going up in flames"
Black Hand Side,Queen Latifah,"
Why y'all ain't say—?!
Yo, you KNOW
You know you was supposed to say something to me
Ooh, baby baby!
Aww yeah
Clap your hands, y'all...
Check it!
Dig it while I rip it
Check it while I wreck it
Give it to em, La!
Okay, gimme a few seconds
First, I give a shout to every
Jersey-born-and-bred head
And everybody in New York
From brunettes to red heads
Who got my back? Jersey got your back!
Yo, tell me who got my back? The Bronx got your back!
Yo, tell me who got my back? Brooklyn got your back!
Yo-yo-yo who got my back? Uptown got your back!
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink fortys
Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on hoo-ooo
That's what we about to do hoo-ooo
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop
But chill
Gimme five on the black hand side
Just chill
Gimme five on the black hand side
Yo chill
gimme five on the black hand side
Uh
gimme five on the black hand side
Come on chill
gimme five on the black hand side
Check it fear don't live in here
Tears don't bring me cheers
So gear for another year because I had it up to here
Yeah, I'm about through with you
You wack and rooty poo
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two
I'm ret to set it off again
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin?
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it
Attack it with my tactics
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket
I flip mines to get mines
I'm happy to get with you
But you can't come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
It's all game
It all sounds the same
Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But they're ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy
I'm the La La La from Halstead
Bred own_name prefix
It's off with your head
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats
So mind your neck, cause it's about to get set
C'mon set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Uh, set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Somebody set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Watch the La, set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Uh, set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Uh, set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Watch the La, set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Checks own_name off
Gimme five on the black hand side
Parlay
Ah uh, yeah threex
Black reign nineteen ninety-three
I'd like to welcome you to this album
Matter of fact, I'd like to welcome you to a new day
A new day to hear me

Why y'all ain't say—?! 
Yo, you KNOW 
You know you was supposed to say something to me 
Ooh, baby baby! 
Aww yeah 
Clap your hands, y'all... 
Check it! 
Dig it while I rip it 
Check it while I wreck it 
Give it to em, La! 
Okay, gimme a few seconds 
First, I give a shout to every 
Jersey-born-and-bred head 
And everybody in New York 
From brunettes to red heads 
Who got my back? GPE got your back! 
Yo, tell me who got my back? The GPE got your back! 
Yo, tell me who got my back? GPE got your back! 
PERSON who got my back? ORG got your back! 
Thank you as I come back into the beat 
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E 
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me 
You know you're too good to be forgotten 
Papa wasn't there but there was PERSON in the house 
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house 
Always flip the script back to the old days 
I used to rock it on the high school stage 
I used to drink fortys 
Back then I didn't blaze 
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days 
Just go on to let you know I flow on 
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on hoo-ooo 
That's what we about to do hoo-ooo 
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U 
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop 
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop 
But chill 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Just chill 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Yo chill 
gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Uh 
gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Come on chill 
gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Check it fear don't live in here 
Tears don't bring me cheers 
So gear for another year because I had it up to here 
Yeah, I'm about through with you 
You wack and rooty poo 
Rip up a crew after I hear the CARDINAL and the CARDINAL 
I'm ret to set it off again 
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin? 
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt 
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack 
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it 
Attack it with my tactics 
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket 
I flip mines to get mines 
I'm happy to get with you 
But you can't come out to play right now 
You got to much shit to do 
It's all game 
It all sounds the same 
Them suckers know my name is 
Sitting on the tips of their brains 
But they're ashamed 
They scared to face me 
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me 
They must be freaking crazy 
I'm the La La La from ORG 
Bred John prefix 
It's off with your head 
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats 
So mind your neck, cause it's about to get set 
C'mon set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Uh, set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Somebody set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Watch the La, set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Uh, set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Uh, set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Watch the La, set it off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Checks John off 
Gimme CARDINAL on the black hand side 
Parlay 
Ah uh, yeah threex 
Black reign nineteen ninety-three 
I'd like to welcome you to this album 
Matter of fact, I'd like to welcome you to a new day 
A new day to hear me 
Check this out ya'll"
I Go On,MC Lyte,"
Yeah! own_name this
Now kick it!
You flap your tongue and talk about this and that
But all of that wrong rap is real whack
I'm on a roll of my own, you can't play me
So own_name baby
Because I think I'm all that, making niggas call back
They hit the cat and I refuse to call em back
It ain't worth it for the moment or the minute
You was in it then you want it but, no, now ya done, kid
I'm only taking shorts if it means I'm wearing em
Some of these guys, yo, I'm only scared of them
They can't handle what I got to give and always will
I'm not the run of the mill
I got skills I go on and on as ya boy, K Born!
But I had to kick em out before the dawn turn em on
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow, ya don't stop
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow or ya don't stop!
A night owl on the prowl, here's a victim
Soon as I spot em bu duh duh, duh duh stick em
Now I got em where I want him
And he's all mine, no crime but now he's on prime time
We hit the door, did the booty in the slow mo
I like to spank em, gave em bacon on the down low
But that's all, that's it, see ya later, hops
I gave ya props but I'm gonna drop ya at the bus stop
Cause you was on it like a hornet dog on it
Got me heated then ya beat it now you know just how to treat it
You kinda slow tho when it comes to brain cells
But you can go cause I came and I did it well
Sorry to hurt ya but honey, I'm a real one
You got to go if you ain't the funky feel one
And when I'm out it I hope that ya not torn
Because my brother life goes on
Now let's swing back on the topic
Brothers wanna pop it, knock it and lock it
I'm not having it cause I control my destiny
I'm never letting a punk get the best of me
So ease up if yo, you on a jealous tip
I'm not about to be the victim in the news clip
Cause unlike some girls I fight back
Or get the boys double up and do a head crack
I only here for the righten night
To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked
So if you coming my way you gotta be strong
Strong enough to know that hitting a women is wrong
Cause just like you, I can find others
Too brothers that do the do quicker than you
So if you looking for a straight up relationship
Keep looking cause I ain't staying kid
Because I'm outta and I hope that ya not torn
But never give up cause life goes on
Yeah coming at you for nineteen ninety-three, pumping in ya car pumping ya jeep
Just like that! I like to give a shoutout to Brooklyn in the house, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island, Uptown, Bronx, New York is definitely in effect! LA! Detroit! Chicago! Atlanta! Virgina! Carolinas! Cacalac! Cacalac!",nan,female,song,"

Yeah! own_ name this 
Now kick it! 
You flap your tongue and talk about this and that 
But all of that wrong rap is re al whack 
I'm on a roll of my own, you can't play me 
So own_ name ba by 
Be cause I think I'm all that, mak ing nig gas call back 
They hit the cat and I refuse to call em back 
It ain't worth it for the mo ment or the minute 
You was in it then you want it but, no, now ya done, kid 
I'm on ly tak ing shorts if it means I'm wear ing em 
Some of these guys, yo, I'm on ly scared of them 
They can't han dle what I got to give and al ways will 
I'm not the run of the mill 
I got skills I go on and on as ya boy, K Born! 
But I had to kick em out be fore the dawn turn em on 
I go on and on and on and on 
Let it flow, ya don't stop 
I go on and on and on and on 
Let it flow or ya don't stop! 
A night owl on the prowl, here's a vic tim 
Soon as I spot em bu duh duh, duh duh stick em 
Now I got em where I want him 
And he's all mine, no crime but now he's on prime time 
We hit the door, did the booty in the slow mo 
I like to spank em, gave em ba con on the down low 
But that's al l, that's it, see ya lat er, hops 
I gave ya props but I'm gonna drop ya at the bus stop 
Cause you was on it like a hor net dog on it 
Got me heat ed then ya beat it now you know just how to treat it 
You kin da slow tho when it comes to brain cells 
But you can go cause I came and I did it well 
Sor ry to hurt ya but hon ey, I'm a re al one 
You got to go if you ain't the funky feel one 
And when I'm out it I hope that ya not torn 
Be cause my broth er life goes on 
Now let's swing back on the top ic 
Broth ers wan na pop it, knock it and lock it 
I'm not hav ing it cause I con trol my des tiny 
I'm nev er let ting a punk get the best of me 
So ease up if yo, you on a jeal ous tip 
I'm not about to be the vic tim in the news clip 
Cause un like some girls I fight back 
Or get the boys dou ble up and do a head crack 
I on ly here for the right en night 
To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked 
So if you com ing my way you got ta be strong 
Strong enough to know that hit ting a wom en is wrong 
Cause just like you, I can find oth ers 
Too broth ers that do the do quick er than you 
So if you look ing for a straight up re la tion ship 
Keep look ing cause I ain't stay ing kid 
Be cause I'm out ta and I hope that ya not torn 
But nev er give up cause life goes on 
Yeah com ing at you for nine teen nine ty three, pump ing in ya car pump ing ya jeep 
Just like that! I like to give a shoutout to Brook lyn in the house, Queen s, Stat en Is land, Long Is land, Up town, Bronx, New York is def i nite ly in ef fec t! LA! De troit! Chicago! At lanta! Vir gina! Car oli nas! Ca calac! Ca calac!","

Yeah! PERSON this 
Now kick it! 
You flap your tongue and talk about this and that 
But all of that wrong rap is real whack 
I'm on a roll of my own, you can't play me 
So PERSON baby 
Because I think I'm all that, making niggas call back 
They hit the cat and I refuse to call em back 
It ain't worth it for the moment or the minute 
You was in it then you want it but, no, now ya done, kid 
I'm only taking shorts if it means I'm wearing em 
Some of these guys, yo, I'm only scared of them 
They can't handle what I got to give and always will 
I'm not the run of the mill 
I got skills I go on and on as ya boy, K Born! 
But I had to kick em out before the dawn turn em on 
I go on and on and on and on 
Let it flow, ya don't stop 
I go on and on and on and on 
Let it flow or ya don't stop! 
A night owl on the prowl, here's a victim 
Soon as I spot em bu duh duh, duh duh stick em 
Now I got em where I want him 
And he's all mine, no crime but now he's on prime time 
We hit the door, did the booty in the slow mo 
I like to spank em, gave em bacon on the down low 
But that's all, that's it, see ya later, hops 
I gave ya props but I'm gonna drop ya at the bus stop 
Cause you was on it like a hornet dog on it 
Got me heated then ya beat it now you know just how to treat it 
You kinda slow tho when it comes to brain cells 
But you can go cause I came and I did it well 
Sorry to hurt ya but honey, I'm a real one 
You got to go if you ain't the funky feel one 
And when I'm out it I hope that ya not torn 
Because my brother life goes on 
Now let's swing back on the topic 
Brothers wanna pop it, knock it and lock it 
I'm not having it cause I control my destiny 
I'm never letting a punk get the best of me 
So ease up if yo, you on a jealous tip 
I'm not about to be the victim in the news clip 
Cause unlike some girls I fight back 
Or get the boys double up and do a head crack 
I only here for the righten night 
To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked 
So if you coming my way you gotta be strong 
Strong enough to know that hitting a women is wrong 
Cause just like you, I can find others 
Too brothers that do the do quicker than you 
So if you looking for a straight up relationship 
Keep looking cause I ain't staying kid 
Because I'm outta and I hope that ya not torn 
But never give up cause life goes on 
Yeah coming at you for nineteen ninety-three, pumping in ya car pumping ya jeep 
Just like that! I like to give a shoutout to GPE in the house, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island, Uptown, Bronx, New York is definitely in effect! LA! Detroit! Chicago! Atlanta! Virgina! Carolinas! Cacalac! Cacalac!"

You John - 
Like, M eighties eighty's), or twin tre eighties DATE 
Young Money First Lady,ya know, baby girl - 
Of the group, I'm also known as baby girl, in the coupe 
Never get me confused, as Baby girl in the hoop 
Cause, John dude 
I'm stuntin on these hoes, like Marilyn Monroe 
I got a S curl flow, I spit slick, ya know? 
And I don't just spit raps, and chit chat 
John John gats 
Ya John crack 
But, John mil 
While these hoes, stay in hoods like rats for real 
My voice stay on tha track, like a ORG for real 
Riding the baseline like, Quille O'Neal 
Gassed ya baby father, for the keys to the Escalade 
Not a baby momma, but I'm drama like, Kay Slate 
What can I say? That's how ya girl do 
Ya girl stay fresh down, to tha cuticles 
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo 
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble 
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves 
PERSON stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines 
Lemme remind you, I'm gettin a tan too 
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from GPE 
They say I'm too pretty, to be spittin sixteens 
I should be on the screen, posin for ORG 
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean 
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll 
Pardon me, if the cockiness, botherin y'all 
I'm PERSON know? 
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J 
Ma you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out 
Doin this since, you was Reebok, Classic Doubt 
Now this ho, wanna get at Nic', why? 
Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since 
PERSON so gutter, lil white tee, need some Air Max on 
Some ORG and Gabbana, pretty panties on

No, not them! Who's your best emcee? 
Nic, Fox, and Kim, can't forget PERSON 
PERSON up in the Porsche Box, or the ORG"

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, Yes, I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
We go, we go We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know Say fuck the world, we riding til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
We go, we go We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know Say fuck the world, we riding til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want Caiah to go to college, just to say We did it!
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And own_name him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go",nan,female,song,"

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent 
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since 
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent 
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant 
Cherish these nights, cherish these people 
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel 
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful 
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool 
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick 
Just yesterday, I swear it was o-six 
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed 
I looked down, Yes, I suppose 
All things go, all things go 
All things go, all things go 
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone 
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for 
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong 
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young 
And we keep going, we go 
We go, we go We wake back up and do it all again 
We know, we know Say fuck the world, we riding til the end 
When all is said and done, look what we've become 
I just want you to know that I did it for you 
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence 
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him 
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'? 
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same 
Even though they know that I love em 
Family ties, broken before me 
ORG trying to kill him, he ain't even call me 
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me 
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes 
The last day he saw me 
All things go, all things go 
All things go, all things go 
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone 
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for 
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong 
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young 
And we keep going, we go 
We go, we go We wake back up and do it all again 
We know, we know Say fuck the world, we riding til the end 
When all is said and done, look what we've become 
I just want you to know that I did it for you 
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just bout my business 
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas 
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me 
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness 
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact 
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that 
She never understands why I'm so overprotective 
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected 
I want PERSON to go to college, just to say We did it! 
My child with Aaron, would've been DATE any minute 
So in some ways I feel like ORG is the both of them 
It's like he's Caiah's little angel, looking over him 
And I know PERSON will always love me, and I'll always love him 
And PERSON him 
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint 
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint 
All things go, all things go 
All things go, all things go"

She said fuck Fendi but I think she was playin
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil Kim her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You own_name lesbian
And she ain't never comin out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is fifty
MTV, hit up BET, tell em pretty, pretty please don't play own_name
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Nothing I do is good enough for you
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin
Cause own_name meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
– Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches
Still I rise, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile Still I might
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell em hi I'mma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight

Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell em hi tell em hi from me
One day you'll remember this

Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you

Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say 
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask PERSON

Cappucino,MC Lyte,"It was a cafe? It was a cafe on the west side
It was a cafe? On
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown
Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, Shut the fuck up!
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind
Death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin over his girl
Another died drivin while intoxicated
Why do people make livin so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary
Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin - or is dead better?
I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane
But at this café was death still callin my name?
Or did this café even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino
Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word Cappucino
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you three dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin shit, it'd be workin
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why? Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino, Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino
It was a café on the west side
It was a café on the west
It was a café on the west side
It was a café on the west

It was a cafe? On the west side, mid town 
It was a cafe? On the west side, mid town 
Said they had the best cap of Cap pu ci no around 
So I stepped in, and I or dered a cup 
Some one grabbed me by my throat and said, Shut the fuck up! 
And I did, pron to, quick fast 
How much longer would the tor ture last? 
In the wrong place, at the wrong time 
It was a drug sale, I could feel from be hind 
Death, it was get tin closer, right be hind my back 
Ready to at tack 
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died 
I could feel it, I was on the oth er side 
In be tween lives, I'm so con fused 
What do I do, oh, what do I do? 
But was it re al ly time for me to go? 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
But then I calmed down, I spot ted some friends 
That I knew in a past life, way back when 
A cou ple had died in a drug world 
And this one guy died fight in over his girl 
An oth er died driv in while in tox i cat ed 
Why do peo ple make livin so com pli cat ed? 
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary 
In tro duced to drugs by her boyfriend Har ry 
He sold crack to the kids on the up town cor ners 
A so cial work er named Han nah Smith tried to warn her 
But she would n't lis ten, no one lis tens 
I saw the light, I awak ened, it was a dream 
Man oh man, you shoul da heard me scream 
So glad to be giv en   my life back 
So good to be livin   or is dead bet ter? 
I did n't have to run from the bul lets or drugs 
And I did n't have to run from the mur der ers or thugs 
I did n't have to wor ry about fallin from a plane 
But at this café was death still call in my name? 
Or did this café even ex ist? 
And was my name just an oth er on the death list? 
I knew it could n't hap pen, even though 
On the bot tom of my shirt was a spot of Cap pu ci no 
Cap pu ci no, Cap pu ci no 
Bust it, to some of you that re al ly don't know 
I break it down to you, the word Cap pu ci no 
It's some what like cof fee, then again not quite 
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light 
They charge you three dol lars, you ask is it worth it? 
But when you start drinkin shit, it'd be workin 
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best 
But if ev ery time I drink I voy age through death 
I leave it alone and just stick to tea 
Cap pu ci no was fly, but too fly for me 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Cap pu ci no 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Cap pu ci no 
Why, oh why? Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cap pu ci no? 
Cap pu ci no, Cap pu ci no 
Cap pu ci no, Cap pu ci no 
It was a café on the west side 
It was a café on the west 
It was a café on the west side 
It was a café on the west

It was a cafe on the LOC side 
It was a cafe? On 
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown 
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown 
Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around 
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup 
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, Shut the fuck up! 
And I did, pronto, quick fast 
How much longer would the torture last? 
In the wrong place, at the wrong time 
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind 
Death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back 
Ready to attack 
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died 
I could feel it, I was on the other side 
In between lives, I'm so confused 
What do I do, oh, what do I do? 
But was it really time for me to go? 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends 
That I knew in a past life, way back when 
A couple had died in a drug world 
And this CARDINAL guy died fightin over his girl 
Another died PERSON while intoxicated 
Why do people make livin so complicated? 
But then I saw a girl, her name was PERSON 
Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend PERSON 
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners 
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her 
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens 
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream 
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream 
So glad to be given - my life back 
So good to be livin - or is dead better? 
I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs 
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs 
I didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane 
But at this café was death still callin my name? 
Or did this café even exist? 
And was my name just another on the death list? 
I knew it couldn't happen, even though 
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino 
Cappucino, Cappucino 
Bust it, to some of you that really don't know 
I break it down to you, the word Cappucino 
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite 
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light 
They charge you three dollars, you ask is it worth it? 
But when you start drinkin shit, it'd be workin 
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best 
But if every time I drink I voyage through death 
I leave it alone and just stick to tea 
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Cappucino 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Cappucino 
Why, oh why? Why, oh why? 
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino? 
Cappucino, Cappucino 
Cappucino, Cappucino 
It was a café on the LOC side 
It was a café on the west 
It was a café on the LOC side

Eyes are the Soul,MC Lyte,"
He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
To push in the bush but took his time
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with
Shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
Live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
Because the eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
I look into his eyes, but he's so high
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
nineteen, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
Robbed and killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
Because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
I look into her eyes, she's so young
But I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
One in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N
To put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell, eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..",nan,female,song,"

He knows he's leav ing, not much time left 
Hold ing on to his very last breath 
I saw him last week, ner vous and up tight 
Los ing sleep, stays up all night 
Wishin he woul da used his mind and not rushed 
To push in the bush but took his time 
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with 
Shared nee dles with 
Wish he could go back, change the di rec tion 
But now he's got the in fec tion 
I spoke to him, gave him in spired words 
I'm sure he's heard 
Live by the sword, die by the sword 
What's left, pray to the oh Lord 
You can de ny but the truth will un fold 
Be cause the eyes are the soul 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
I look in to his eye s, but he's so high 
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly 
He has prob lems he does n't like solv ing 
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops re volv ing 
nine teen, his eyes full of tears 
He has n't smiled at least for a year 
His mom is gone cause he was high one night 
Robbed and killed her, be cause of the crack pipe 
He's want ed by the law 
Be cause he's robbed at least three gro cery stores 
He's lost, all con trol 
Take a look, eyes are the soul 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
I look in to her eye s, she's so young 
But I know, where she's comin from 
I've watched her grow, lit tle girl down the street 
White shirts and skirts with pleats 
She cried, fear in her voice 
Not know ing, she had a choice 
Oh so sad, oh so lone ly 
If she knew that she's not the on ly 
One in school that did n't use the cau tion 
Fac in, raisin a ba by or abor tion 
Her moth er said she had to leave 
Who wants to be where a ba by is not re ceived 
No ul ti ma tum, she's goin to the G.Y.N 
To put it to an end 
She's learned a les son I sup pose 
I can tel l, eyes are the soul

He knows he's leaving, not much time left 
Holding on to his very last breath 
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight 
Losing sleep, stays up all night 
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed 
To push in the PERSON but took his time 
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with 
Shared needles with 
Wish he could go back, change the direction 
But now he's got the infection 
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words 
I'm sure he's heard 
Live by the sword, die by the sword 
What's left, pray to the oh Lord 
You can deny but the truth will unfold 
Because the eyes are the soul 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
I look into his eyes, but he's so high 
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly 
He has problems he doesn't like solving 
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving 
nineteen, his eyes full of tears 
He hasn't smiled at least for a year 
His mom is gone cause he was high one night 
Robbed and killed her, because of the crack pipe 
He's wanted by the law 
Because he's robbed at least three grocery stores 
He's lost, all control 
Take a look, eyes are the soul 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
Eyes are the soul.. 
I look into her eyes, she's so young 
But I know, where she's comin from 
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street 
White shirts and skirts with pleats 
She cried, fear in her voice 
Not knowing, she had a choice 
Oh so sad, oh so lonely 
If she knew that she's not the only 
CARDINAL in school that didn't use the caution 
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion 
Her mother said she had to leave 
Who wants to be where a baby is not received 
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N 
To put it to an end 
She's learned a lesson I suppose

Rich Nice
WOO!  C'mon
SICK!  Uh-huh
YES!  WOO!
HOLLA!
I be thinkin bout that big - O
The way you used to rock it to me nice and slow
You used to do it til my back felt broke
You used to say give it to me - I'd say no
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my earrrs
And you would buy me pink pretty under-wearrrs
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice
And you would make me feel like makin love twice
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now move it round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck
Nine to five, do it live, sho nuff
I be thinkin bout the way you do it good
I like it cause you raised in the hood
Uhh, you put your back into it
I tell you no, change my mind, then I do it
You cute, you fine, you fire
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
Heather Hunter must of got me inspired
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired cause
I can't stop thinkin bout you
Or the way you do what you do
With you I can not lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes
I can't stop thinkin bout you
The way you do what you do
With you I can not lose
Now let me put it down
 I be thinkin bout the way you do it good
 I be thinkin bout the way you do it good YES!!
 I be thinkin bout the way you do it good
He wan take me to a ho-tale, see if it's good
If the nigga sm-ale, when I put it down
He like OH YEAHURR
Taste like apples and a bag of PEARS
Right here, right dere, everywhere
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wooden chair
He like to hear me moan like MMM-YEAH
Boy's in the zone and I don't care
Sittin on his lap, pullin on my track
He piggidy piggidy piggidy piggy my back
In fact no slack, damn he the mack
He ain't got to work me like dat

 I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
 I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now move it round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck
Nine to five, do it live, sho nuff",nan,female,song,"

You used to do it til my back felt broke 
You used to say give it to me   I'd say no 
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my ear rrs 
And you would buy me pink pret ty un der  wear rrs 
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice 
And you would make me feel like makin love twice 
What I'm say in, you the man, I'm in love 
And I like when you do it rough 
Hey shorty I can't get enough 
Can't stop, won't stop   call me Puff 
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up 
Now move it round, break it down, hold up 
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck

Heather Hunter must of got me in spired 
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired cause

Or the way you do what you do 
With you I can not lose 
I put it down like some brand new shoes 
I can't stop thinkin bout you 
The way you do what you do 
With you I can not lose 
Now let me put it down

If the nig ga sm ale, when I put it down

Right here, right dere, ev ery where 
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wood en chair

Boy's in the zone and I don't care 
Sit tin on his lap, pullin on my track

Rich Nice 
WOO! C'mon 
SICK! Uh-huh 
YES! WOO! 
HOLLA! 
I be thinkin bout that big - O 
The way you used to rock it to me nice and slow 
You used to do it til my back felt broke 
You used to say give it to me - I'd say no 
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my earrrs 
And you would buy me pink pretty under-wearrrs 
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice 
And you would make me feel like makin love twice 
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love 
And I like when you do it rough 
Hey shorty I can't get enough 
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff 
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up 
Now move it round, break it down, hold up 
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck 
Nine to five, do it live, sho nuff 
I be thinkin bout the way you do it good 
I like it cause you raised in the hood 
Uhh, you put your back into it 
I tell you no, change my mind, then I do it 
You cute, you fine, you fire 
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired 
Heather Hunter must of got me inspired 
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired cause 
I can't stop thinkin bout you 
Or the way you do what you do 
With you I can not lose 
I put it down like some brand new shoes 
I can't stop thinkin bout you 
The way you do what you do 
With you I can not lose 
Now let me put it down 
I be thinkin bout the way you do it good 
I be thinkin bout the way you do it good YES!! 
I be thinkin bout the way you do it good 
He PERSON take me to a ho-tale, see if it's good 
If the nigga sm-ale, when I put it down 
He like OH YEAHURR 
Taste like apples and a bag of PEARS 
Right here, right dere, everywhere 
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wooden chair 
He like to hear me moan like MMM-YEAH 
Boy's in the zone and I don't care 
Sittin on his lap, pullin on my track 
He piggidy piggidy piggidy piggy my back 
In fact no slack, damn he the mack 
He ain't got to work me like dat 
I'm the boss 
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired 
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired 
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love 
And I like when you do it rough 
Hey shorty I can't get enough 
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff 
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up 
Now move it round, break it down, hold up

Who the hell is this?
Calling me at twelve:forty-seven in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?
Remember them chicks from the Bricks round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's own_name do
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I own_name sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming",nan,female,song,"

Who the hell is this? 
Calling me at twelve:forty-seven in the night 
While I'm watching the fight 
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight 
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right 
It's my girl PERSON from out in GPE 
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry 
Car seat in the back like he started a family 
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying? 
Remember them chicks from the FAC round nine six 
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project? 
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister PERSON 
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria 
I didn't say them 
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when 
Some bitch named PERSON 
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim 
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim 
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you 
What's PERSON do 
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker 
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker 
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker 
ORG send her to her maker 
ORG send her to her maker 
They heard about his good sexing, long erections 
Nice complexion, PRODUCT for protection 
They even heard about his tongue game 
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop til the cum came 
But that's words of Hip Hop 
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona 
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es 
If I find out he got a next Mrs 
What you think all the goons is for 
CARDINAL by the door, a few more out in New York 
And I feed em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean? 
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen 
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail 
Got a scale for what's in the mail 
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail 
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales 
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man 
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan 
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha 
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep 
I PERSON sleep 
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet 
And watch you smoke like a cigarette 
Should've left the bitch a pack of ORG 
Leave all them foul bitches wet 
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew 
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through 
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming"

Mis-Education of own_name
Shout out to my girl Lauren
Yo, yo
It's funny how money change the situation
You can talk greasy on the radio station
They hatin cuz I'm the creation
My song spun in heavy rotation
Some own_name dumb
I burn rappers like tannin under the sun
Everything own_name done
I'm the first lady there's no comparison
Since the trail I've tried to avoid violence
But if they come test we run for me gun

Let own_name stung
own_namen this way since, day one
I fear none but my status will scare some
Haters keep makin false accusations
Always got my name in they conversation
Disloyal fools I'm still the champion
You might win some but you just lost one 
Now my attitude's turned cold
Girls sell they soul just to have my flow
Like Keyshia Cole they just need to let it go
The game to be sold and not to be told
Wisdom I hold til the youth gets old
To the hopeless now I'm on Hope Road
Dudes floss cash and they know they in debt
Never own_name pimp
Can't slick talk I done heard that shit
Can't lie to a liar I re that shit
I run the club called the Players Residence
I'm not only a client, I'm the president
Did the crime, now the time you can't handle it
But ima play it out to it's full out extent
I came from the Stuy project tenement
Style wild like a child off punishment
About me everyone got opinions
A lot of rap chicks but I'm still number one
Must be prepared cos the rain soon come
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one )",nan,female,song,"

Yo, yo yo 
ORG fire 
Mis-Education of John 
Shout out to my girl PERSON 
Yo, yo 
It's funny how money change the situation 
You can talk greasy on the radio station 
They hatin cuz I'm the creation 
My song spun in heavy rotation 
Some PERSON dumb 
I burn rappers like tannin under the sun 
Everything PERSON done 
I'm the ORDINAL lady there's no comparison 
Since the trail I've tried to avoid violence 
But if they come test we run for me gun 
It's funny how money change the situation 
You can talk greasy on the radio station 
They hatin cuz I'm the creation 
My song spun in heavy rotation 
Some PERSON dumb 
I burn rappers like tannin under the sun 
Everything PERSON done 
I'm the ORDINAL lady there's no comparison 
Since the trail I've tried to avoid violence 
But if they come test we run for me gun 
Let PERSON stung 
PERSON this way since, day one 
I fear none but my status will scare some 
Haters keep makin false accusations 
Always got my name in they conversation 
Disloyal fools I'm still the champion 
You might win some but you just lost CARDINAL 
Now my attitude's turned cold 
Girls sell they soul just to have my flow 
Like Keyshia Cole they just need to let it go 
The game to be sold and not to be told 
Wisdom I hold til the youth gets old 
To the hopeless now I'm on Hope Road 
Dudes floss cash and they know they in debt 
Never PERSON pimp 
Can't slick talk I done heard that shit 
Can't lie to a liar I re that shit 
I run the club called the Players Residence 
I'm not only a client, I'm the president 
Did the crime, now the time you can't handle it 
But ima play it out to it's full out extent 
I came from the PERSON project tenement 
Style wild like a child off punishment 
About me everyone got opinions 
A lot of rap chicks but I'm still number CARDINAL 
Must be prepared cos the rain soon come 
You might win some but you just lost CARDINAL 
You might win some but you just lost one )"
nan,Nicki Minaj,"
You know, it just dawned on me
I am own_name
I ain't know the president live in DC
And own_name Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't know I be with Paris and Lindsay
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
I fly girl pop up, and I fly girl dip
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it, I fly girl sip
Now get that Rosé, get that, get that Rosé
A little Hennessy and Louis the thirteenth
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all my haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now
You got me wrong
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
If he don't p-p-pull up, let the record replay
Record replay, r-r-record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
I ain't know the police was the Babylon
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now
You got me wrong
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
If he don't pull up let the record replay
Record replay, record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ
Fuck em like sexin', why they be flexing
When they know that this they song?
So interesting, fronting like they texting
Damn, them bitches got me wrong
Got me wrong wrong wrong
Got me w-w-w-w-w-wrong
Got me w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wrong
You got me wrong
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do",nan,female,song,"

You know, it just dawned on me

And I don't nev er guz zle it, I fly girl sip

You can act like you don't like it but you do 
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

Record re play, r r record re play 
I think I'm gonna kill the moth er fuck ing DJ

So pa parazzi flick ing, be flick ing their cam era 
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit 
My fly girl stom ach and my fly girl hips

And I can on ly kiss an oth er fly girl lips 
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ

Now ev ery body look my way, my way 
Ex cuse all the haters cause they look ing side ways 
Let's get it now

You be sit tin by the bar when it's your song 
You can act like you don't like it but you do 
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

You know, it just dawned on me 
I am PERSON 
I ain't know the president live in GPE 
And John Lewinsky 
I never knew that dude with PERSON was Pimp C 
And I ain't know I be with GPE and PERSON 
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit 
I fly girl pop up, and I fly girl dip 
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip 
And I don't never guzzle it, I fly girl sip 
Now get that Rosé, get that, get that Rosé 
A little PERSON and PERSON the DATE 
Now everybody look my way, my way 
Excuse all my haters cause they looking sideways 
Let's get it now 
You got me wrong 
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song 
You can act like you don't like it but you do 
You do, you do, do, do, do, do 
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ 
If he don't p-p-pull up, let the record replay 
Record replay, r-r-record replay 
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ 
I ain't know the police was the PERSON 
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche 
I never knew my titties was bigger than PERSON 
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera 
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit 
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips 
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts 
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips 
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ 
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné 
Now everybody look my way, my way 
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways 
Let's get it now 
You got me wrong 
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song 
You can act like you don't like it but you do 
You do, you do, do, do, do, do 
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ 
If he don't pull up let the record replay 
Record replay, record replay 
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfucking DJ 
Fuck em like sexin', why they be flexing 
When they know that this they song? 
So interesting, fronting like they texting 
Damn, them bitches got me wrong 
Got me wrong wrong wrong 
Got me w-w-w-w-w-wrong 
Got me w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wrong 
You got me wrong 
You be sittin by the bar when it's your song 
You can act like you don't like it but you do 
You do, you do, do, do, do, do"
Lyte Thee MC,MC Lyte,"
From now on it's not own_name
Listen own_name MC
Tackling, anyone, who tries to stop me
From fulfilling, the ultimate, the ultimate goal
Suckers takin up room on the microphone
I do pay for crowds, move over, stop stalkin me
I feel like I'm drownin and fans are just stompin me
Bigfoot! Should we buck the uncivilized
But I'm so tame I don't, mean to criticize
But why you sweatin we don't, go together
Especially if I'm muggy in the rainy kind of weather
Listen own_name MC
Competition I take it as good for the soul
Pull back the microphone, let my arms unfold
Release all the anger, all the aggravation
Convert it into words just sorta like a conversation
I am the talker, you're just the listener
Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you?
The problem is you can't understand
The logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you
Merely step aside, what all, call the weak
But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin down the street
You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk
And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk
But I, I never do, small talk I like to hear
Other girls rap and you say that I'm whack~?!
Comin from a female that is totally dedicated
Every rhyme I say you ought to appreciate it
And if not I'll tell you like I told my neighbor Dana Betty
What? You ain't ready
For a fly female emcee you just ain't ready
Competition I take it as food for the mind
Past experience from the future, is the best kind
Of advice that you could EVER receive from another
Whether it's a stranger or your night time lover
Sorry silly rabbits, Trix are for kids
Brings back memories of the things that I did
Played jokes on suckers, just for fun
But now I'm much older, those days are done
Everything is business, forget about games
You see cause once I'm finished, you're gonna know my name
Is own_name chillin
Better known as the emcee villain
No I'm not good but I'm not bad either
Come into your life it can't get no liver
So now, competition is taken out of my vocabulary
I don't vary, I bury
Steppin up is like diggin your grave
So sucker emcees you ought to save
All the mess you be talkin, meanwhile hawkin
When I'm on the stage, audience watchin
Suckers in the corners just keep on clockin
The way I hold the mic, the stance I use
The rhymes I recite and the beat I choose
But it's not your fault because you don't know better
You see green I wear you go buy the same sweater
You look me up and down sight the jeans name brand
You go to Macy's and for hours you stand
On own_name wearin
Don't try to lie homegirl I caught you starin
Cause yo, the beat is dope and the rhymes are kickin
I'm the chickenhawk and you are the chicken

From now on it's not PERSON 
Listen John MC 
Tackling, anyone, who tries to stop me 
From fulfilling, the ultimate, the ultimate goal 
Suckers takin up room on the microphone 
I do pay for crowds, move over, stop stalkin me 
I feel like I'm drownin and fans are just stompin me 
Bigfoot! Should we buck the uncivilized 
But I'm so tame I don't, mean to criticize 
But why you sweatin we don't, go together 
Especially if I'm muggy in the rainy kind of weather 
Listen John MC 
Competition I take it as good for the soul 
Pull back the microphone, let my arms unfold 
Release all the anger, all the aggravation 
Convert it into words just sorta like a conversation 
I am the talker, you're just the listener 
Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you? 
The problem is you can't understand 
The logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you 
Merely step aside, what all, call the weak 
But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin down the street 
You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk 
And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk 
But I, I never do, small talk I like to hear 
Other girls rap and you say that I'm whack~?! 
Comin from a female that is totally dedicated 
Every rhyme I say you ought to appreciate it 
And if not I'll tell you like I told my neighbor Dana Betty 
What? You ain't ready 
For a fly female emcee you just ain't ready 
Competition I take it as food for the mind 
Past experience from the future, is the best kind 
Of advice that you could EVER receive from another 
Whether it's a stranger or your TIME time lover 
Sorry silly rabbits, ORG are for kids 
Brings back memories of the things that I did 
Played jokes on suckers, just for fun 
But now I'm much older, those days are done 
Everything is business, forget about games 
You see cause once I'm finished, you're gonna know my name 
Is John chillin 
Better known as the emcee villain 
No I'm not good but I'm not bad either 
Come into your life it can't get no liver 
So now, competition is taken out of my vocabulary 
I don't vary, I bury 
PERSON up is like diggin your grave 
So sucker emcees you ought to save 
All the mess you be talkin, meanwhile PERSON 
When I'm on the stage, audience PERSON 
Suckers in the corners just keep on clockin 
The way I hold the mic, the stance I use 
The rhymes I recite and the beat I choose 
But it's not your fault because you don't know better 
You see green I wear you go buy the same sweater 
You look me up and down sight the jeans name brand 
You go to Macy's and for TIME you stand 
On John wearin 
Don't try to lie homegirl I caught you starin 
Cause yo, the beat is dope and the rhymes are kickin 
I'm the chickenhawk and you are the chicken"

Does she do it like me?
Does she work that body?
Throw that ass like pu-pump-pump-pu-pump that hottie
Do she handle it like she got a deep throat?
I mean suck that cock til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X?
Try it with me and tell me who's the best
Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat?
Do she fuck your brains out til you fall asleep?
Bet you she don't fuck you
Like you know I fuck you
And I bet you she will never do, oh
All the things I'll do for you
Is she drop-dead fine?
Does she like it from behind?
Is she fly?

Does she slurp it, rub it, jerk it, ride it?
Tell you how you feel when you inside it

All the things I'll do for you

And niggas give they life to be with me for one night
